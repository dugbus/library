Package


A squad game where you buy the software that is used to control/communicate with the team. So the manual and packaging are geared towards this conceit. Login, email etc. After failures you have to redeploy with new troops and the bodies of the last lot could litter the battlefield.

A lot of the stuff below is quite PC centric. Needs simplified for tablet.

Overview

Loose Cannons is a squad based strategy game, in which the player controls a small group of heavily armed soldiers and specialists in a near future setting. Like the Magnificent Seven or the Dirty Dozen, the Loose Cannons always find themselves handed the most difficult assignments, in the toughest locations. Often operating deep within enemy territory they must make the best use of any resources they find, in order to succeed at their appointed tasks.

The player takes on the roll of Squad Commander, issuing orders from a remote location to each of the units individually. Setting waypoints for their movement and controlling how they react to their environment and contact with hostile forces. In order to succeed the player will have to learn how to use the capabilities of each of the available units to maximum effect, both on their own and in combination with those of other team members.

In addition to a unique skill set and attributes, each member of the squad will also have their own personality and background, which the player will be wise to take into account when forming their strategy for each of the assignments.

Presentation

The game will be presented as if it were actual software written by the military for the issuing of orders to units in the field.

When the game is loaded the player sees what they would see if they were the commanding officer of the squad sitting down at their control console. After logging into the Unit Management Application (UMA), logos will flash up and the game reports that the interface is initialising, during what appears to be a boot sequence.

The player will have a choice of Assignments, as well as training missions and Exercises (Multiplayer).

Once an Assignment has been selected the background of the control interface becomes a video feed from the mission’s location with a Tactical Overlay to facilitate the retrieval of important information and the issuing of orders. (In the bottom corner there will be a version number.)

Pop up windows with responses from individual units and objective messages from Central Command will all be consistent with the interface concept.

Pause mode brings up a screensaver in keeping with the rest of the application.

Tactical maps (satellite feeds) will be displayed in the same interface.

Order static satellite photos using resource points. Upgrade quality. Enemy troop movements pinpointed.

Interface

While the player is issuing orders, game time stands still, in a frozen moment, allowing careful consideration of the situation. Once the player has established a strategy for the soldiers to follow and issued their instructions the game returns to real time and events unfold in response to the player’s decisions. (Unit feedback should occur as normal when issuing orders.)

Each action that the units can take requires a set amount of time, which is reflected in their on screen activities. The Mission Time will be shown next to each waypoint.

Alerts and directives from Central Command are stored in the form of mail, which the player can check at any time. A shortcut button allows the player to jump to the location of any alert.

Mission objectives have their own button to provide quick access.

Character images act as shortcuts to active units, with the relevant function key shown next to their name.

This display and info overlays could flicker like a video composite like the HUD in a plane with occasional distortion, fading.

Selecting a character brings up a display of their current status and allows the player to set waypoints and targets for the character to follow.

At each of these waypoints the character’s attitude can be changed by altering the settings on the display.

The first waypoint is the character’s current position and status.

Each waypoint stores changes to attitude as well as location.

A video overlay on the main screen allows the player to get feedback from the soldiers as they move to follow their orders. Each character exhibits unique traits and personality as the situation unfolds, showing emotional responses to instructions and events.

(I’m not going over there mister. They’ll shoot me)

As a small example of character, some of the units could have different names for the Commander. Most will say sir, but less disciplined units might say chief or boss.

Display should whoosh and be alive with things moving and counting. (Range to target, threat assessments etc.)

Information overlays on screen will indicate character’s status. Cross symbol if in need of medical attention, under fire icon.

Important messages could come from the characters through the alert system.

Have an ear icon or sonar pulse to indicate that one of your units has heard something, followed by a voice message, with text.

Hovering unit icons shows waypoint path on view.

Use Hold order like a pause. Rest of sequence can be set and unit paused until the time is right for them to move. Could be button on unit panel.

Use a mission clock to help synch units. Show estimated times actions will be complete on waypoints.

Colour code waypoint markers to indicate likely danger?

Number of dots between waypoints indicate move speed. More dots = slow movement.

Tactical overlay shows location of visible enemy units. Last known location, lost contact etc.

Waypoint etas change if unit gets involved in combat, held up.

Squad Members

Individuals gain experience and improve their skills the more they are involved in missions and can specialise in different areas of expertise, Small Arms, Heavy Weapons, Medic, Electronics, Sniper, Engineer, Communications, Recon, Demolition etc.

Character information could be presented in the form of a computerised assessment showing the character’s areas of expertise like a qualification or certificate, Marksman Grade 3, for example, as well as test results for physical and mental ability.

During missions the characters left behind have a limited amount of training time available to improve their skills. Field experience is more valuable than training.

Units will talk to the player by video link. They will initiate contact, rather than only responding to orders. “In position sir” “Enemy contact” Click on comms window to move main view to location.

Some characters call the player by different names. Boss. Chief etc.

Drag or carry injured comrades.

Units fatigue faster if set to very alert.

Make alertness important. First shot off important.

Unit view could show medical scan, allowing player to select which wounds to treat first.

Give units the ability to dig in?

Use of cover very important. Dinking round corners.

Sarge - Ground leader of the Loose Cannons.

Rookie - Newest recruit, fresh from the academy, gets a lot of advice. (Train rookies to make other units.)

Night - The covert operations specialist, laconic.

Eagle - Observer

Grunt - Basic infantry.

Flo - Medic.

Wrench - Engineer/Technician.

Bart - Heavy Weapons

Cobra - Sniper

Damage

Realistic damage locations will result in specific injuries, a hurt leg will cause a limp, an injured arm inaccurate firing or the inability to use a two handed weapon, limit the amount that can be carried, distance grenades can be thrown etc.

Serious injuries incurred during combat may result in characters needing time to recover in hospital.

Critically injured units become unconscious and have to be transported to the evacuation point.

Overhead icon shows general health. Red cross symbol, green, yellow and red.

Send Medics to other units by targeting units icon or have a MEDIC! button. Or alert.
Commands
Characters are selected by clicking on them or their icon, or pressing the relevant function key.

LMB is used to set or select waypoints. (Click and drag to reposition waypoints)

RMB is used to target actions?

MMB could drag the map or pan and tilt the camera.

Space toggles Play/Pause (Tactical Mode)

Characters follow the sequence of waypoints and follow out the orders stored at each one when they reach it.

All actions take a realistic amount of time.

The length of some actions will vary depending on the character performing them. An electronics expert will be able to diffuse a bomb more quickly and safely than someone who is untrained.

Only the currently equipped weapon or item is ready for immediate use.

Changing weapons and reloading takes time.

When issuing orders to use a weapon or item that is not currently equipped the character should automatically change over.

Characters involved in combat will reload automatically when their ammunition is depleted. They can also be forced to perform a RELOAD action. Before bursting through a door it may be advisable to have a full clip.
Line Of Sight
Characters will have accurate fields of view and line of sight. Enemies that are not visible to any member of the player’s team will not be displayed unless a suitable scanning device is in use or some kind of satellite observation is occurring.

Enemies and objects in a character’s peripheral vision will only be partially visible, becoming more noticeable as they move into the character’s main field of view?

As a character becomes fatigued its field of view will narrow.

Being on higher ground will give characters a better view.

Binoculars and sniper scopes will provide more range but less width.

A character which has its attention focused on an area that is not in the direction it is travelling will move more slowly.

Characters and enemies would have to do some kind of perception test to notice immobile, prone opponents.

Player units and enemies will react to sound cues as well as visual.

Have destructible scenery. Blow up trees. Grenades could start fires.

Firing while moving is bad for aim. See Black Hawk Down. (Need good pseudo military jargon.)
Actions
The ability to perform an action will be dependant on the character being properly equipped and trained.

Performing an action automatically sets a waypoint.

To use a weapon or piece of equipment the player would select the item and then select a target. If the player targets a location important to the mission the character will switch to the relevant piece of equipment automatically.

The unit would automatically use a toolkit when repairing an object or place a Small Charge when blowing a locked door. The object being used will be shown in the waypoint information.
Equipment
UFO style research and development?

There will be a wide variety of weapons and equipment available to fill each character’s encumbrance allowance. Under equipping a character will improve their movement.

Units could have finite amounts of ammo, which they need to replenish.

Player could aim mortar etc, worm’s style to be more involved.

Use flares to illuminate night missions.

Make it a paintball game.

Need somewhere to put reload.

Mortars (heavy weapons take time to set up, require 2 man teams)
Motion sensors/Proximity detectors.
Sentry guns
Smoke grenades (blown by the wind, need indicator)
Stun grenades
Smart grenades
IR goggles
Binoculars
Remote probes
Motion trackers
Gas masks
Paint Pellets
Environment suits
Laser targeting
Combat armour
Mines and traps
Guns, lots of guns
Nanotech construction droids (programmed at base to make something specific then taken to target.)

Two character weapons like mortars and heavy machine guns. First sets up, second character assists.
Enemy Forces
Different behaviours can be used in combination to create interesting mixes of strategy. Some enemies like to hide. Some enemies like to attack. Some enemies like to keep their distance. Some enemies will taunt. Some missions will feature specific opposition.

In some of the side missions the use of novel opposition could add variety. Contain an outbreak of zombies, or hunt down an escaped wild animal for example.

The opposition does not have to have equivalent units. Zombie outbreak etc.
