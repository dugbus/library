# Hamster Ball

Like rumball but on its side 2d that you rotate the screen to cause the ball to move.

tap screen to hop gaps and do jumps.

Hold screen to boost to smash breakables.

Maybe just flick to change direction.

Warps, switches, extra time collects.

Boosters to get faster.

Speed bumps.

Rough or sticky ground you have to build up speed to cross.
