# Socialise

Perform some task that other players need done. Like water virtual plant. But players can't reciprocate and you can't do more than one task for a particular other player.
Something gets set in motion every morning and the player has to take some action to stop it. But maybe they canâ€™t act immediately. They have to wait for it to have gone 50 feet so they have to work approx what time in the day it will have gone that far.
