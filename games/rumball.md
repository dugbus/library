# Rumball

Marble madness like game but with smashable objects and switches.

Ball is super heavy but has low friction so you can give it spin to curve round corners like a bowling ball.

The aim is to complete each hole with the least amount of stroking or quickly if that turns out to be difficult to communicate. Could have a stroke meter that runs down as you control the ball.

Courses would have banks and troughs and ridges.

Control

This is the old record/playback scheme from the initial design. Would still be interested to try it out. Maybe a bonus mode or something.

When the player takes a shot they have a limited amount of time to put spin on the stationary ball by rubbing across it. Once the shot timer ticks down to zero the ball is released and the rubs the player applied to the ball while it was stationary are replayed influencing the ball as it moves through the course.

The direction and strength of the player's rubs can be shown during playback by arrows that appear over the ball, allowing the player to better understand how their actions influenced the balls movement. While recording the player's rubs the direction and strength of each rub could be recorded on a timeline. Each set of rubs would constitute a stroke in golf terms.

The player would be allowed a limited number of practice strokes to experiment with rub strategies.

This control scheme would allow quite complex actions to be applied to the ball, speeding up, slowing down, changing direction and applying spin.

There could be a more traditional fall back, Old School Mode where players would pull away from the ball to indicate the strength and direction of the shot. This mode could employ a variation of the rub influence mechanic as a kind of aftertouch.

Courses

3 or 4 themed courses would be available in the initial release with additional courses and possibly a course editor available later.

Mad Science, Tropical Island, Candyland, Industrial Revolution, Wet and Windy

Scoring

Stroke records for each hole would be stored both for full round and composite (best for each hole). Online leader boards are a possibility.

Multiplayer

Up to 4 players could take part in a round. Shots are taken simultaneously to reduce waiting times with the other player's balls appearing ghosted. Once everyone had played their tee shots a course map would show relative positions and the players would be able to play their second shots and so on. Maybe allowing everyone to play an entire hole before synching would be better.

Engine

The engine for this game could then be used in other products including, Rub-It! Racer



Roller modes
Stream of rollers come down screen, flick left and right to put them in the right buckets
Race through a course, breakable barriers, moving bumpers
Holes, move rollers to correctly coloured holes
Chase, catch moving targets, tap the corners to centre on a particular roller
Gems, like race but collect gems to increase time allowed
Spin up, rev the roller up for 3 seconds then it gets released, see how many pins get hit, a bit like peggle
