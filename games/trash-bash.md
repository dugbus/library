# Trash Bash

Rub on the screen to collect disparate bits of trash together into a pile, then flick it into some sort of receptacle.

A simple game of flicking piles of trash into a trash can or other receptacle.
Each level starts with an overview map letting the player see where the trash and cans are located as well as some likely hazards.

Tapping a magnifying glass in the top corner quickly zooms in out.

Tap Bash It! to switch to game view. Tap near a pile of trash to move the playerâ€™s character next to it (the character moves more or less instantly or at least absurdly fast) then flick to whack the trash pile in the direction of the flick, hopefully landing in or near a trash can. The majority of the trash bounces as if it was a single object but the odd bit of debris bounces away and turns to dirt marking the map if technically possible. The more similar the angle of the character relative to the trash is to the angle of the flick, the further the trash will go. If the trash reaches a can it drops in regardless of speed.
Alternately, tap a pile of trash and the character moves to it. Rotate the character around the pile, like lining up a pool shot and then swipe to bash the trash.
Speed to complete is the key value possibly with level of remaining dirtiness (ie number of strokes needed, remember dirt comes off the trash piles each time they are bashed).
Early levels just have one or two cans and no adversaries but later maps can have several trash cans, introducing a small element of strategy and obstacles (eg barriers that open and close). Adversaries could be things like sleeping dogs or cats or even ghosts, depending on the theming of the level. More complicated levels will need a way to quickly switch from the game view to the overall map and back again. Moving the character on the overmap should be possible.
Could flick with finger if touch screen can pick that up.
