# Looking Up

Explore and collect treasure from a unique perspective. The game is viewed from below ground, looking up so that the only things that are seen clearly are the parts of characters and objects that are in contact with the ground.

The players character is controlled using an automated push, moving away from the players point of contact with the screen. This allows precise angled movement without the use of an onscreen joypad or similar mechanism.

The character stays in a a soft zone in the center of the screen to give maximum visibility and to allow plenty of space for the player to place their finger without obscuring the character.

Dungeon crawl collecting treasure and avoiding monsters and traps.
Some of the monsters are allergic to light so the player has to use torches, pools of illumination and moving lights to stay safe.

Stroke direction for the character to move. Tap to stop. Speed of stroke is the same as movement. Slow stroke, character creeps. Fast stroke character runs. Maybe length of stroke would be better.

So imagine three sets of crushing blocks. You can dash - stop - dash - stop - dash or just do it in one stroke if you got the speed right.

Could have crumbley ground that breaks if you run or blind monsters (they live in the dark) who can't detect you when you creep.
