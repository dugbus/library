# Coin Sweep Release

Codevelop, an independent game studio, based in Edinburgh, Scotland are excited to announce the release of their latest game, Coin Sweep. Available now for free download from the App Store, Coin Sweep takes you back to a time when a jar of pennies was all the fun you needed.

Puzzle your way through a multitude of levels, swiping coins to match targets. Combine smaller denominations to build higher value coins and reach big targets like a champ. Using the fewest coins possible lets you make Perfect Change.

Numerous hazards await on later levels including the devious Coin Changer, which can turn your precious pounds into pennies. Spinners, Padlocks, Burners and Freezers will also appear to ruin your plans. But don't worry hazards only appear after a specific number of swipes, so take your time and plan ahead. No need to rush.

To help beat the hazards you have a few special abilities at your disposal. Keep Count will track the value of the coins you have in your current swipe, Coin Eraser will get rid of those unfortunate coins that get in the way of your Perfect Change. You can also summon Extra Coins when you are running low and Clean Up will stop all the Hazards in an emergency.

Coin Sweep comes with Euros, Sterling and US currencies to unlock so you can practice counting change for your holidays.

Codevelop are a new team of veteran developers who cut their teeth on PC and console games in the 2000s and have returned to the industry after many years in the corporate wilderness to see what all the fuss is about.
