# Amazing

The maze moves and you have to navigate your way through it, a little bit like scramble but you tap on the screen to move your character instead of controlling them directly. The maze sometimes changes direction and can even rotate as it moves! There will be occasions where you go through a door and what was the interior of the walls becomes the safe part of the maze and viceversa. At other times the map will go dark and you will have to Stay In The Light as you follow a puddle of light through the maze. Monsters and treasure and whatnot as well.
Sometimes the maze will stop and there will be a treasure room or some similar reward.
Could combine this with Tombes.
