# Weed Whacker

You are a gardener patrolling the garden, where tiles have either weeds or plants on them. To whack the weeds you use a flamethrower and a hose to water the plants.

The flame thrower fires in whichever direction you are facing. The longer you hold in the button the further the fire goes. Obviously this isnâ€™t very discriminate so you have the water to put out fires on normal plants and to give them a growth boost.

You can pick up bonuses like fertiliser or weed killer.

Once the plants have matured you can harvest them.

Once a weed has been burnt away you can plant in the empty plot.

A monkey occasionally turns up to steal your plants. If you spray him with water he runs away but if you accidentally burn him he goes mad, causing massive damage to your crops.

Because the farmer fires in the direction he is facing you control him by dragging so he is easy to turn round as he faces the direction you move him in.

Three buttons along the bottom - fire sow/reap water or maybe repeated down both sides of the screen.
