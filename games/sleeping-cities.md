# Sleeping Cities

Kid/Robot Vulnerable/Destructive

When the kid is in the robot he can stomp about making a mess of things but will often encounter doors or pits where he has to get out and sneak around throwing switches to allow the robot to proceed.

        The fabulous land of Atlantis was not destroyed by a great cataclysm. The fate that befell the Atlanteans was the destruction of the island that had acted as a conduit between their world and our own. Isolated, within the Hollow Earth, where they had established a great civilisation, their society began to degenerate, spiralling down into a state of decay and corruption, a dark shadow of its former glory. As their society crumbled around them, the ruling caste of Elders squabbled amongst themselves, struggling for positions of power on the High Council, only realising when it was too late, that they had nothing left to rule.
        
Twelve thousand years later, in the latter half of the eighteenth century, employees of a Bavarian owned mining company uncovered a cache of Atlantean artefacts. The unfortunate workers died in an accident soon after but the items made their way to the company’s owner, a Bavarian noble known only as the Baron.
        
Eventually the Baron was able to activate one of the devices and establish a means of communication with the long forgotten Atlanteans, who now refer to themselves as the Fallen. A bargain was struck and the Baron created the Illuminati, a secret organisation dedicated to fulfilling the wishes of their Hidden Masters.

OVERVIEW



What Is Illuminati?
Illuminati: The Sleeping Cities is the first episode in a fully immersive 3D action series, which combines classic exploratory gameplay with high-octane set pieces.

The player’s character is entangled in a web of intrigue through their relationship with a murdered Scientist and becomes embroiled in a fiendish plot to take over the world. The climax sees the player crossing into an Alternate Reality to battle the dreaded Illuminati and destroy the mysterious Unifier, a device with which they seek to enslave all humanity.

Illuminati: The Sleeping Cities has its design origins in the conspiracy theories of a secret ruling elite. At this, the start of a new millennium, these theories have become more accepted by a public seeking answers to the otherwise inexplicable events that plague modern society. Referencing a long history of public paranoia, Illuminati plays on some of the more resilient theories to have taken root in the public consciousness.

Illuminati: The Sleeping Cities, is a product based on the combination of strong design, ground breaking visuals and the increased polygon throughput of next generation consoles.  By using Edgies tried and trusted ‘E2os’ technology, development of world creation code will be accelerated, allowing more time to be devoted to the unique look of the game and its highly engaging storyline.

Multiplayer and cooperative modes will be included to complement the single player experience with Edgies expertise in network and Internet gaming enhancing the quality considerably. 


BACKGROUND
Timeline
1776
The Order of Illuminati is founded on May 1 in Bavaria.

“Its professed objective was, by the mutual assistance of its members, to attain the highest possible degree of morality and virtue, and to lay the foundation for the reformation of the world by the association of good men to oppose the progress of moral evil.”

The Order attracts a powerful and influential membership of more than two thousand, spread across the majority of Europe and Scandinavia.

Those who have not been initiated know little of the Order’s aspirations and objectives. Rumours of strange ceremonies and rituals abound.
1784
On June 22 the Bavarian Government issues an Edict suppressing the Order.

Membership goes into decline and by the end of the eighteenth century no visible sign remains.
1875
As the winter throws its cold arms around the City of London a strange malady affects the population.

“They say things haven’t been this bad since the plague, with so many people falling victim. Why and where this blight has come from no-one yet knows.”

Those afflicted fall into a deep and enduring slumber from which there is seemingly no recovery and a mass exodus begins, as those who are able, abandon the City and its mysterious curse.

Even a moment of unconsciousness seems sufficient to render the unfortunate susceptible and cases have been reported where a fall, or knock to the head have resulted in the loss of all reason and faculty.

The Government and medical establishment are at a loss and none of their Investigators are able to offer either a plausible explanation or a viable solution.

Hospitals become choked by the influx of Sleepers. Many of these unfortunates remain on this side of the Great Divide, even though their bodies are nothing but atrophied husks. What dreams they must endure.

Towards the end of the year, the first cases are reported from Paris.


1876
London is a barren wasteland where only those with no alternative scavenge out a meagre existence.

Paris grows weaker every day, and both Vienna and Prague join the list of the afflicted.

There is no sign of spring for the occupants of the remaining Great Cities, as the one-hundredth anniversary of the Illuminati’s foundation approaches…
History
In 1775, while conducting a display of harmonic resonance, the Baron, a reclusive nobleman and natural philosopher, made a startling discovery. During the experiment, which was intended to demonstrate the use of his Resonator as a weapon, a shimmering Portal was opened, a window into a blasted and ruinous Alternate Reality. 

Further experiments refined what he named the Transgression process, allowing limited communication with the inhabitants of the other Reality and eventually the transference of an Emissary from their world to ours. Referring to itself as an Illuminated One, it sought the Baron’s aid in a cataclysmic plan.

Enthralled by the Emissary and its promises of power, the Baron formed the Order of the Illuminati to find like-minded souls who would aid him in carrying out the Emissary’s wishes. Only those who graduated to the order’s Inner Circle were made aware of their true purpose.

Once a sufficient number of allies had been recruited and under close scrutiny from the Bavarian government, the Order was dissolved, its members returning to their positions of power and trust across the continent.
  
As their anniversary approaches, the Baron, and the descendants of the original Illuminati are close to brining the Emissary’s grand scheme to fruition.

After many years of experimentation, the Unifier, a much more powerful version of the original Resonator, has been completed. This device is capable of realigning the Realities and allowing the Illuminati to take control of our world. All that is required is a suitably vast source of power.

The Baron has developed Hybrid Technologies, combining his own scientific and technical abilities with Arcane Knowledge supplied by the Emissary. One of the fruits of this collaboration is a device capable of stripping the life force, or Essence from a person whose consciousness has been disrupted.

The Baron has been using stolen Essence for many years to prolong his own life and has recently established a series of powerful Energy Siphons in Europe’s most populace cities. To activate the Unifier will require the life force of more than 1 million people.

With the population of London already depleted, Paris on the brink and Vienna and Prague both beginning to suffer, the culmination of the Baron’s machinations is in sight. The world stands on the threshold of slavery and destruction.

Outline
Played from a third person perspective, The Sleeping Cities begins in an almost deserted London where the player will uncover some of the Illuminati’s secrets before moving on to famous locations in Paris, Vienna, Prague and Washington.

Within each of the cities there will be several areas in which the adventure unfolds, arranged in a hub and spoke formation, so that exploring different sections will return the player to familiar territory.

The player will have a specific objective in each of these areas to provide a focus for gameplay with thorough exploration revealing bonus pickups and equipment.

The action will be continuous, as the Illuminati use stolen Essence to animate and transport a constant stream of adversaries against the player. As well as the Illuminati themselves, the player will battle Roman armour, stuffed Yetis and the distillation of evil. A wise player will find a way to destroy or deactivate the transportation Portals the Illuminati use.

Logic puzzles will provide a diversion from the action, finding the key for a locked door, locating a lever to activate machinery and so on. Some objectives will require more stealth to complete successfully, with a two-fisted approach resulting in failure.

Some areas will be re-visited as the Illuminati plot continues to unfold. For example, a previously abandoned warehouse may become a hive of activity or a broken ladder is repaired in the player’s absence, allowing access to new areas. These changes will be designed to give the player a sense of the plot unfolding around them.

An especially difficult challenge will be used as the climax to the player’s adventures in each of the cities, in combination with other set pieces that mark progress through the game.

Old style newspaper covers will be used to indicate plot developments through headlines and photographs, marking the completion of important tasks as a photograph of the player’s character appears on the front page under an appropriate headline. 

The Cities are linked by different modes of transport, which will provide novel difficulties for the player. An underground trolley ride through twisting tunnels, a battle aboard a flaming airship hundreds of feet above the ground, balancing precariously on the roof of a speeding train and duelling a giant squid aboard a luxurious Ocean Liner will test the mettle of even a hardened adventurer.

As the player travels, the route they take will be drawn on an animated map, in homage to many of the great adventure films and serials.

The player will spend the majority of the game pursuing the mysterious Baron, their ultimate aim being to thwart his plans, defeat the Emissary and destroy the Unifier before it can be used to merge the Realities.

CHARACTERS
Introduction 
The player takes on the roll of an Orphan who stumbles on part of the Illuminati plot while visiting an old madman who lives in an abandoned Sanatorium.

The former Scientist babbles incessantly about strange creatures and the evil forces at work in the world and shows the Orphan the entrance to a secret tunnel. Pounding on the locked door interrupts him.

Concealing the child into a musty closet the old man turns towards the door just as it bursts open. From inside the closet the Orphan sees the Baron, accompanied by a strange creature, one of the Illuminati. A muffled argument ensues ending when the Baron strikes down the old man.

The Baron and the creature leave allowing the Orphan to emerge. Kneeling beside the Scientist’s body, the Orphan is startled to see the madman’s Essence, a translucent Spirit, rising out of his body and floating off down the narrow tunnel. The Orphan heads off in pursuit of the Spirit and discovers that the tunnel ends in a perilous drop into a room full of crates.

The Spirit disappears through a locked door on the far side of the room, leaving the Orphan trapped, the entrance to the tunnel above, out of reach. With time to explore, the Orphan finds a crowbar and is then able to examine the contents of the crates. In some of them the parts of a remarkable Robot will be discovered.

The Orphan can assemble the Robot but lacking any power source it remains inert. When the Orphan leaves the inactive Robot the door bursts open and the Spirit returns, closely pursued by more Illuminati. After a chase round the room the Spirit disappears into the Robot, which suddenly comes to life. The Orphan can now climb aboard and deal with the Illuminati. 

While inside the Robot the Orphan will be able to compete on an almost even footing with the various monsters, creatures and Illuminati agents found throughout the game but there will be times when they will have to leave this relative safety and explore areas inaccessible to the bulky device.

The Orphan will be forced to leave the Robot in order to cross some fragile structures or climb ropes and some tunnels and passageways will be too narrow. The player may also choose to have the Orphan leave the Robot behind temporarily to adopt a more stealthy approach in certain situations.

As the player will be very vulnerable when not inside the protective casing these sections will be especially tense, as the player sneaks to an objective and then dashes madly back to the Robot once their presence has been discovered.

The consciousness of the Spirit animating the Robot will communicate guidance and information to the player through onscreen messages and prompts. Although, due to his slight grip on sanity these pronouncements may not always be comprehensible.

Statistics
All characters and creatures have assigned values in the following categories. For the player, in-game pickups will be available which enhance these attributes.
Strength
Measures the raw physical power of a character or creature. Primarily used to modify damage when involved in hand-to-hand combat, this value can also be used to determine the amount of time required to move or break through obstacles.
Dexterity
This statistic is a measure of agility and co-ordination. Defining the speed at which the character or creature moves and their ability to dodge attacks. This value can also be used as a check when performing an exceptional physical feat requiring great agility.
Intelligence
Rates the brainpower, alertness and adaptability of a non-player character or creature. Intelligence is used as a check when determining the success of knowledge based actions. It will also be used to determine the responses of non-player characters and creatures to the player’s actions, especially in combat.
Health
A measure of vitality and well being, this value determines the amount of damage that can be sustained by a character or creature.

For the Orphan, the Robot provides a degree of protection from the various creatures that the player encounters on their travels. It can absorb the Essence that is released by a fallen enemy and use it to repair damage and power itself. Once it is fully drained the Robot will become immobilised and the player will be ejected to fend for them self, until they can locate a source of Essence with which to re-energise the Robot.

The Health Bar comes in two versions. The Physical bar indicates the Orphans health, which can be replenished through time, by finding one of the occasional Medical Boxes or by a sympathetic NPC who has some medical ability. The Mechanical bar indicates the damage protection provided by the Robot. This amount can be increased up to the maximum strength available by absorbing Essence. This information is only displayed when the Orphan is inside the Robot.

During Set Piece encounters the oppositions Health Bar will also be displayed on screen to allow the player to see how close the challenge is to completion.

When the main character becomes low in health they will appear tired. When not active they will begin to doze and must be moved to avoid having their Essence Siphoned.

Strength: 8
Dexterity: 16
Intelligence: -
Health: 8

Weapon: Variable
Damage: -

An unfortunate orphan, this child has had an under-privileged upbringing but has learned to survive in the harshest of conditions. A streetwise imp who is not adverse to a bit of pilfering, the Orphan knows the back way into several important buildings and has been witness to many strange occurrences. This is their first adventure to feature a wearable Robot and creatures from an Alternate Reality.

When outside the safety of the Robot, stealth and agility are all that stand between the Orphan and oblivion, being at a severe physical disadvantage to the forces of the Illuminati. All hostile encounters should be avoided. Without the Robot the Orphan will almost certainly be defeated.
Robot
Type: Player Character

Strength: 16
Dexterity: 12
Intelligence: -
Health: 15

Weapon: Variable
Damage: -

Immensely powerful and capable of sustaining a significant amount of damage, the Robot was originally conceived as a contraption to be used for exploring the moon.

Supporting Cast
Over the course of the adventure the Orphan will encounter a number of unique individuals who will have some part to play in the unfolding drama. All of these characters have their own agendas, but may provide, perhaps inadvertently, important information to aid the Orphan’s mission.

Strength: 14
Dexterity: 15
Intelligence: 12
Health: 14

Weapon: Rifle
Damage: 8-16

A globetrotting dilettante who has dabbled in many professions but has so far failed to find something sufficiently challenging to hold his attention, the Adventurer thinks that he has mastered a wide range of skills but in truth his competence in many is questionable. This does not prevent him from jumping in with his preferred solution, which is best exemplified by his consistent ability to pull the wrong lever at crucial junctures. He is currently on a mission of vengeance. Despite his occasional bumbling he is a man of his word, and will not rest until the threat of imminent invasion has been averted.
Cleaner
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 12
Dexterity: 14
Intelligence: 8

Weapon: Broom
Damage: 2-12

Every public building needs a cleaner, with their meticulous ability to blend into the background they are be privy to many strange exchanges.

Countess
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 10
Dexterity: 16
Intelligence: 14
Health: 12

Weapon: Foil
Damage: 6-12

The wealthy daughter of an Aristocrat, one of her ancestors was involved with the formation of the original Order of the Illuminati. She is very well educated in areas that generally concern the Aristocracy, such as wine appreciation and etiquette. Her real world experience has been, until recently, rather limited and she tends to view situations from her own peculiar perspective.

Her father has always denied he would have preferred a boy.
Doctor

Strength: 13
Dexterity: 12
Intelligence: 17
Health: 10

Weapon: Punch

Femme Fatale
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 10
Dexterity: 16
Intelligence: 15
Health: 12

Weapon: Knife
Damage: 4-12

An experienced practitioner of intrigue and mistress of disguise and manipulation this agent of a foreign power has been investigating the plans of the Illuminati for some time.

Strength: 14
Dexterity: 13
Intelligence: 13
Health: 14

Weapon: Cane
Damage: 4-12

Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 13
Dexterity: 10
Intelligence: 15
Health: 14

Weapon: Pistol
Damage: 2-12

Being on duty in the streets of Paris at this difficult time would be challenge enough for most men. But this conscientious and diligent officer has found himself dealing with forces far beyond his comprehension. He will be encountered seeking answers from above in the Cathedral and despite this test of his faith manages to treat events, no matter how extraordinary, in a practical, matter-of-fact way. He knows someone is responsible, and would dearly like to make an arrest.
Journalist
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 9
Dexterity: 11
Intelligence: 14
Health: 11

Weapon: Pen
Damage: 2-12

The word feisty was invented for this determinedly independent young woman. This is a difficult time for the fairer sex to make their way in almost any profession and she deserves some congratulations for perseverance, if not for the quality of her writing. Content is king though, and if she can get her tale to the presses she feels people will have no option but to treat her with more respect.

Major
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 10
Dexterity: 10
Intelligence: 10
Health: 8

Weapon: Revolver
Damage: 4-16

A pompous retired army officer who still thinks he can cut the mustard on the front lines and is a font of almost limitless bad advice. Since the war the Major has suffered from insomnia and spends his evenings wandering the streets of Prague in full dress uniform. He will be deeply motivated by the players tale and may prove useful as a temporary diversion to lure some awkwardly positioned Illuminati away from an important location. Whatever his faults, and there are many, he will at least get to go out like the old soldier he is.
Opposition
Over the course of the adventure, the Orphan will encounter many creatures and enemies. Some will be humans corrupted by Illuminati influence, while others will be objects animated by the power of stolen Essence. All are to be feared, as they strive to bring about the Unification of the Realities and the subjugation of the Human Race.
Anarchist
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 12
Dexterity: 12
Intelligence: 11
Health: 10

Weapon: Bomb
Damage: 10-20

A well educated and disaffected former student and veteran of various left-wing political organisations. He is the nephew of the Baron and though he does not necessarily agree with his uncle’s aims, he is happy to go along with them, so long as they result in the downfall of the fascist bourgeoisie. He is a very, very angry man with a tendency to lob bombs at every available opportunity.

Baron
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 13
Dexterity: 14
Intelligence: 18
Health: 13

Weapon: Punch
Damage: 2-8


The Illuminati Agent in charge of Unification, he is responsible for the Scientists murder and is a ruthless and efficient tactician. The Baron plays a leading role as the Orphan’s adversary and is currently in the process of visiting each of the Great Cities and collecting the Essence he has stolen through the Energy Siphons he has placed there.

Throughout the game, the Baron leads the player a merry chase, through fleeting glimpses and the occasional tirade, before running off in the direction the player must go. He will evade capture until the very end of the game, where, as is traditional, he will get his comeuppance.

During their pursuit of the Baron the player will often be hampered by his liberal use of the Energising Ray. He will bring all sorts of things to life in an attempt to put an end to the Orphan’s meddling.
Conjuror
Type: Non-Player Character

Strength: 12
Dexterity: 15
Intelligence: 18
Health: 13

Weapon: Chop
Damage: 4-12

A Chinese stage magician on tour with the State Circus, this strange character is encountered in Vienna where his company have been performing at the Opera House. His magic is not actually a trick, but deceptions invigorated by the addition of real magical ability. He may appear slightly sinister, but he has the friendly demeanour of an Old Gent. A master of sorcery, he learned his art during the Tsung Dynasty and has been in league with the Illuminati and their evil schemes for some time.

Evil Robot
Type: Enemy

Strength: 15
Dexterity: 12
Intelligence: 10
Health: 15

Weapon: Cannon
Damage: 8-16

When the ways of the flesh proved too unpredictable for the Baron he turned his attention to an all-mechanical version of the Golem. A combination of clockwork, hydraulics and cast iron, the Evil Robot can punch straight through walls. In addition to his melee abilities he has been fitted with a mini-cannon, which is fortunately very slow to reload. Due to his shortage of intellect it is sometimes possible to use his strength against him.
Golem
Type: Enemy

Strength: 15
Dexterity: 10
Intelligence: 10
Health: 14

Weapon: Punch
Damage: 4-12

The Golem is one of the Baron’s early experiments in reanimation. A hybrid of body parts and machinery, the Golem is fairly mindless but the combination of metal and flesh renders him a dangerous opponent. As the battle rages the Golem will have a tendency to lose body parts and may eventually be reduced to an agitated torso.
Roman Soldier
Type: Enemy

Strength: 13
Dexterity: 14
Intelligence: 13
Health: 10

Weapon: Short Sword
Damage: 4-12

Created by the Baron energising ancient suits of Roman armour, these entities retain vestiges of the disciplined soldiers who fought and died wearing them many years before. They attack in formation, using the famous turtle defence against missile attacks. When in close combat they form a line, using their shields for defence while making quick stabs and advancing relentlessly.

Shadow
Type: Enemy

Strength: 16
Dexterity: 10
Intelligence: 10
Health: 15

Weapon: Heat Ray
Damage: 8-16

As the Energy Siphon gathered the combined Essence of the city Sleepers, a scum was seen to form. Here were the black hearts and broken dreams of an entire community distilled into one fetid mass. When unleashed the nightmare creature formed is a force of primordial fury and frustration. He will do anything to get to his intended victim and is particularly difficult to destroy because of his incorporeal nature.
Terracotta Warrior
Type: Enemy

Strength: 18
Dexterity: 15
Intelligence: 5
Health: 5

Weapon: Spear
Damage: 6-12

Similar to the Roman Soldiers this fighting force was buried with the Emperor to protect him through eternity. Centuries passed before they were unearthed and brought to the Museum as part of a travelling display. Reanimated by the Baron, sheer weight of numbers makes them a deadly threat. A solid blow will shatter their fragile clay bodies into a cloud of dust and shards.
Yeti
Type: Enemy

Strength: 14
Dexterity: 14
Intelligence: 12
Health: 13

Weapon: Claws
Damage: 5-10

The Abominable snowman of legend shot and killed during an expedition to the Himalayas by a famous Victorian explorer. Being dead has done nothing to salve the savage temper of this nomadic beast. When awakened by an infusion of Essence its last memory is of being shot. The resulting ferocious attack is best dealt with from a distance.

Illuminati
These beings from an Alternate Reality travel to our world through Portals created by the Baron to aid him in his execution of their plan. They come in several different variations, all equally unpleasant.
Elder
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

Blessed with Psyonic powers, their decaying bodies are strapped together to prevent the strain of channelling the enormous energies at their disposal from tearing them apart. Their five mundane senses have been sacrificed to empower the sixth. The back of their skulls pulse gently and swell, glowing, when they are employing their powers to the fullest.
Emissary
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

The first of the Illuminati to cross into our world and the driving force behind the Baron’s activities, the Emissary is the Puppet Master behind the Baron. He will not be encountered until the very end of the game when the Orphan must cross into the Alternate Reality to destroy the Unifier. The Emissary will be the final hurdle.

Feral
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

The fastest moving of the Illuminati, the Feral uses its natural speed to avoid attacks and to inflict damage on its opponents. The Feral darts from place to place so quickly it is almost impossible to follow. The astute will attack the place where the Feral is going, not where it is.
Glutton
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

Characterised by their lack of musculature and dense minds, they can be lured into vulnerable positions and are easily dispatched from a distance. If they succeed in getting close to their target the huge gash in their belly opens to reveal several rows of serrated teeth capable of inflicting terrible damage. The Glutton can project a sticky tongue like protrusion that it uses to draw victims into its gaping maw. Hooked talons make escape almost impossible.
Guardian
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

The heavy armour that encases the Guardian is actually part of its body. This allows it to sustain a significant amount of damage and still function. Wounds inflicted on Guardians cause parts of their carapace to break off, leaving them vulnerable to further attacks. Guardians are armed with short lances that they can use to drain their opponents Essence. 

Howler
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

One of the largest of the Illuminati and possibly the least intelligent, the Howler can unleash a mighty subsonic roar, devastating to all those caught in its path. These blasts are slightly debilitating to the Howler who must take a few moments to recover before giving voice again.
Hunter
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

The Hunter uses its bat like wings to travel swiftly and its keen sense of smell to alert it to the presence of enemies. It often acts as a scout, or spotter for other Illuminati, but when forced into combat the powerful talons on its legs can inflict severe damage as it hovers just out of reach.
Scorpus
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

Nimble and as agile as a monkey, these Illuminati can climb on walls and ceilings. Often travelling in packs they are a significant threat when encountered in a group. The Tentacle that extends from the top of their heads can be used to lash out during combat and can also, when suitably attached, give the Scorpus mental control over others.

Slayer
Type: Enemy

Strength:
Dexterity:
Intelligence:
Health:

Weapon:
Damage:

These tall powerfully built Illuminati are the masters of several different weapons and are also skilled in unarmed combat. From traditional swords to their favoured Crescent Blade, the Slayers live up to their name. In battle they often become a flickering blur, seemingly striking from many different directions simultaneously.

LOCATIONS
The Sleeping Cities takes place in some of the most distinctive and beautiful locations of the Victorian era, allowing the rich graphical tapestry to instil a sense of time and place. The architectural styles will vary to suit the unique character of each of the player’s destinations.

As well as the general exploratory gameplay there will also be a series of set pieces in each location, used to punctuate the action and provide progression for the story. The familiar device of bracketing the screen to indicate a cut-scene will accompany non-interactive exposition. All cut-scenes will be performed in engine to provide continuity in visual quality and to aid in player immersion.
London
Asylum
A Gothic monstrosity that still echoes with the cries of the insane as they receive their treatment. An old paranoid insomniac is encountered who is convinced that if he falls asleep his soul will be stolen. Of course this turns out to be true.

This level will be used to set the tone of the adventure and to provide an opportunity for the player to become acquainted with the control system in a relatively benign environment. The eventual means of escape from this area will be through the sewers.
Sewers
Tiled walls lined with clay and a slimy floor littered with shallow puddles. A central sump room will provide a series of challenges to turn valves or activate machinery which lead slowly to its filling with water. The water pressure eventually raises a floating platform allowing access to the upper levels.
Museum
This building has only recently been completed and has yet to be opened to the public. Some of the exhibits are still under construction. The museum houses a wide collection of artefacts and curios, among which is concealed one of the Illuminati’s Energy Siphons. The foyer has a particularly striking ceiling of stained glass domes that cast down shafts of light to the floor below. 

The player will face a product of the Illuminati’s animating power for the first time here when they must subdue a pair of stuffed Yetis from one of the exhibits and the newly restored armour of a group of Roman soldiers.

Towards the end of their adventures in the museum the player will also confront the Shadow after becoming trapped in a pillared hall. The player will not be able to tackle the Shadow directly and will have to lure it into destroying a series of pillars and bringing down the ceiling. This will allow the player to escape across the piles of fallen masonry.

Underground
The basement of the museum will provide access to a branch of the London underground used to deliver artefacts to the Museum. This will lead to a series of tunnels that plunge deep beneath the Channel on their way to the Illuminati’s next Energy Siphon in Paris.
Paris
Secret Railway
The player races a flood wave through the Illuminati’s secret railway to reach the Catacombs that riddle the ground below Paris. 
Catacombs
This section will be tight and claustrophobic as the player makes their way through the maze like passages; the Catacombs eventually lead the player to the Crypts below Notre Dame Cathedral.
Crypts
Here, the player will locate the next Illuminati Siphon and will have to battle dusty reanimated bodies brought back to life by the Baron.
Notre Dame
Once above ground the player will face off against a creature made from stained glass in a battle across the pews of the cathedral’s main floor.

A perilous ascent of one the bell towers of Notre Dame will allow the player the opportunity to stow away on the Baron’s personal Airship as he makes his escape from Paris with the Essence he has gathered there. 

Before the end of the journey the player will be discovered and will have to battle their way past the Illuminati to escape, as the burning Airship plummets towards the ground far below.

Prague 
Streets
Prague’s narrow medieval streets provide the location for the player’s next set of adventures.
Stairway
One of the set pieces for this location takes place when the player must dodge barrels thrown down from above in order to attack the Golem at the top of a long staircase. Each time the player ascends the stairs and inflicts damage on the Golem they will be thrown back down to land with a thump in front of the camera. Until on the final occasion the roles are reversed and the player is triumphant.
Station
The Prague section will end when the player makes their way through a freight yard to board a departing train that the Baron is using to transport an Energy Siphon and the Essence stolen from Prague.
Train
The player will have to make their way along the roof of the train, ducking under bridges and jumping over telegraph cables while fighting off Illuminati henchmen, as the rear carriages are discarded one by one.

Vienna
Opera House
A building of immense opulence, the back and below stage areas of the Opera House provide a warren of passages in which the Illuminati have concealed another of the Energy Siphons. Treacherous gantries above the stage and the trapdoors on it will provide many opportunities for surprise and excitement.
Storage
Finding their way into a storage area below the main stage the player encounters a room full of mirrors. The ray weapon, which the player has recently come into possession of, can be bounced off highly polished surfaces. The player will have to use this to their advantage in order to defeat their enemies. The angle of the mirrors can be adjusted by shooting the backs, allowing the player to set up complicated ricochets while remaining relatively hidden.

The player will encounter the Conjuror here who will provide some magical opposition.
Ocean Liner
A short trip on a doomed ocean liner leads to a set piece in which the player must defeat a marauding giant squid by chopping away its tentacles to reach its vulnerable head where the fatal blow can be administered. Once again stowing away aboard the Illuminati’s submersible will lead to the Orders undersea headquarters of Schloss Illuminati.
Schloss Illuminati
Courtyard
A Bavarian Schloss (castle) constructed in a giant bubble of glass a thousand fathoms beneath the waves. The player will initially be trapped in the courtyard, a vast and exposed open area.
Laboratories
This will be by far the most Gothic location, filled with strange devices and the creatures that have resulted from the Illuminati’s experiments.
Cells
The majority of the Baron’s biological experiments reside in the area below the laboratories. The Baron will unleash them all against the player as he struggles to make his escape.
Portal
Having destroyed Schloss Illuminati, the player will follow the Baron through a Resonance Portal to the final location in Washington and a confrontation with the Baron and his Illuminati master. 
Washington
Capitol Building
Here the player will finally corner the Baron and face him on equal terms as he dons his own version of the Robot Suit.
Unifier Chamber
The injured Baron’s last act is to energise the Unifier and begin the process of merging both realities. As the effect slowly spreads out from the Unifier to engulf the world the player must cross over to the Illuminati reality and battle the Emissary.
Illuminati Reality
The player must survive the Emissary’s attacks while working to destroy the Unifier before the merging process becomes irreversible. When they finally succeed the initial explosion will leave the Robot incapacitated as more Emissaries emerge from the darkness. Just as all seems lost a shockwave will rip out from the damaged machine dissolving any remaining Illuminati and returning the Orphan to their own world.

CAMERA MODES
There are two distinct Camera Modes employed in The Sleeping Cities. The majority of the game will be viewed in a Free Range Mode that allows the player to explore the available game world, hacking and slashing the Illuminati and their allies in the process. 

At specific points during the story the game will enter Set Piece Mode, similar in style to classic games of yesteryear that had an end of level bad guy to defeat or a particularly clever method of escape to find.

Some of these set pieces will teach a particular skill, giving the player a new technique to employ at other stages of the adventure, while others will be twitch tests pushing the players previously acquired skills and reactions to their limits.
Free Range Mode
The staple viewpoint for the player has the camera positioned above and behind, looking down on the player’s back. The camera will not focus directly on the character but will lead in front of them to provide a better idea of what lies ahead. The faster the character is moving the more the camera will lead but the character will always stay in view.

Movement of the camera will be smoothed to prevent sudden changes of direction from being too jarring and it will be possible to manually adjust the camera by using the second analogue controller on the joypad. Pushing left and right will rotate the camera around the character. Pushing up will raise the camera and pull away. Pushing down will lower the camera angle and close in on the character.

The camera will seamlessly follow the player as they explore the world, meeting and greeting non-player characters, collecting objects, fighting and solving puzzles.

During predetermined events like opening doors and pulling switches the camera will briefly adopt an appropriate viewpoint.

Whilst in Free Range Mode, the player will also be able to adopt a first person view in order to more closely examine their surroundings. The character will be stationary while in this mode and any movement or other activity will return the camera to its previous state.
Set Piece Mode
Special events mark the player’s progress through the game and provide specific challenges to be overcome.

In general, for these scenes the camera will be more fixed or restricted in its movements. Depending on the situation it could be closer to the player than before, in the corner of a room looking across or low to the ground to give a sense of scale and occasion as an Illuminati rises above. This mode will add greatly to the sense of drama.

For example, when the player leaves Prague by train. After a short cut-scene showing the train leaving the station, the camera will adopt a position behind the train looking almost horizontally along its roof for three or four carriages. When the player is in the middle of the roof the camera will look straight down the length of the train but as they move to the edges the camera will turn, showing the sides of the train and the windows through which Illuminati may emerge.

If the player steps over the edge to hang from the roof in an effort to avoid overhanging obstacles, the camera will swing round to show the side of the train flat on as the player uses left and right to dodge attacks before pushing up to climb back on the roof.

Other examples would be when crossing a broken bridge the camera drops to a side view which tracks with the character. This allows the player to better judge when to jump to avoid the gaps in the planking. Or when dodging crates thrown down a flight of stairs by enemies at the top the camera will pull back, showing the character at the bottom of the screen and a good view of the stairs above.

GAME STYLES
Solo
The standard game takes the form of an unravelling storyline adventure, where the player is taken through a series of open form locations, each of which, when completed, lead to the opening of a new area. Puzzle solving, combat and character development all contribute to the gaming experience.

Three different difficulty levels will be available to tax the player, Easy, Normal and Hard. As well as removing some of the pickups and increasing the strength and number of enemy units, the location of important items will be different on higher difficulty settings. This will extend the length of play, as well as making the game more of a challenge.
Co-Operative
This is a two-player version of the single player game where both players share the same screen real estate, as they work together to defeat the Illuminati’s fiendish plan. The level maps and difficulty settings would be the same as the single player game and any area that has been opened in Single or Co-Operative modes would be available to play.

A Competitive Co-Operative mode is also under consideration.
Deathmatch
These games will take place in specially designed areas where the players will be able to choose to play as some of the non-player characters and creatures available in the main game. The idea being to hunt and kill your opponents with a variety of different weapons, some of which may not be available in the main game. 

Options available for customisation will include, Time Limit, Kill Limit and Weapons Restrictions. A number of variants on the classic Deathmatch will be available.
Carnage
This is similar to the standard Deathmatch game but adds a number of less powerful enemies to the fray. The aim being to achieve the most kills in a set time period or to reach a target number.
Scapegoat
One player is the designated Scapegoat and becomes the target for all the other players. Only the Scapegoat scores points for kills. Any player who kills the Scapegoat becomes the Scapegoat.

CONTROL SYSTEM
It is presumed that the controller to be used has at least two buttons, two analogue sticks, a digital pad and two shoulder buttons. PS2, Xbox and Gamecube all share these features.

Button and control functions will change slightly depending on the situation facing the player but these changes will be consistent and intuitive.

The player will be given the option to use alternative control assignments on the controller options screen.

In all modes possible actions will be auto-completed when the Action button is pressed and the relevant item is available.

For example, when the character approaches a locked door and presses the Action button, if they have the correct key in their possession, whether or not it is the currently active object, the character will automatically change to the correct item of inventory, unlock and open the door and return to their previous state once this action is completed.

Auto-completed actions will be accompanied by an appropriate animation.
Start Button
Will Pause / Restart the action in the game. 

Gamecube Note:        
As the Gamecube only has a Start/Pause button, the options screen would be displayed here.
Option Button
The options panel will appear which displays,

Continue:        Continue the game.
Restart:        Restarts the game
        
Camera:        This will change the preset camera angle.

Music Volume:
SFX Volume:

Save:                Save the game at the current point.

Quit:                Quit to frontend, with a ‘Do you wish to save’ prompt.



Free Range
Left Analogue
Controls character movement. Pushing a little in a specific direction will orientate the character to face that way, push a little more and they will creep forwards. Pushing half way to the limit walks and going all the way results in a full run.
Digital Pad
Controls access to the characters inventory. Moving up and down scrolls through the different categories of item that the character is carrying. Pressing left and right selects a specific object or ability.

For example, pressing up, up, up will scroll through an icon list representing Weapons, Objects and Misc. Pushing left and right will choose between the different items in that list. Pressing action will close the window.
Right Analogue
Controls the camera. Pressing left or right rotates the camera around the character. Pushing forward zooms in on the character and lowers the camera angle. Pulling back zooms out and raises the camera for a more overhead view.
Shoulder Buttons        
Side step left or right. Pressing the shoulder buttons whilst the character is moving will make them dive and roll in that direction. This can be used to evade attacks or dive under things such as arrow traps and swinging blades.
Button 1 - Action
When confronted by an enemy it will elicit an attack. When near an object it will pick it up. If next to another character it will instigate a conversation. Also used to fire weapons, pull levers and open doors. Picking up an object will show information on the object before it disappears into the inventory.
Button 2 - Defend
When involved in combat pressing this button will result in a blocking action that reduces damage suffered from any current attack.
Button 3 – Crouch
Lowers the character into a crouching position in order to hide behind objects for protection or to avoid detection. It is also possible to move while crouched although quite slow. 
Button 4 – Jump
If stationary, the character will perform a vertical leap in an attempt to reach platforms or ropes that are out of reach. If the character is moving, they will leap in the current direction of travel. The Jump animation will vary depending on the speed of the character.

Set Piece
These controls are for Set Piece situations where the player is facing one main opponent. In other instances where the objective is different the controls will vary accordingly.
Left Analogue
As the character is in combat they will always face their opponent. Consequently moving forward and back on the stick will move the character, closer and further away from their enemy. Pushing left and right will make the character move in a circling motion with their opponent at the centre. This is standard movement with fighting games.
Shoulder Buttons
Pressing left or right will result in a hop to the side in order to avoid danger.

All other button functionality remains the same.

GAME ELEMENTS
Pickups
There are many different items scattered throughout the game world. Some of these items are of particular benefit to the player, giving them some advantage over their enemies.
Essence
Little clouds of energy that are released when an animated entity is destroyed or when someone loses consciousness in the vicinity of an Energy Siphon. 
Smelling Salts
If the player encounters someone who has only recently been relieved of their Essence, a strong dose of smelling salts may bring them round for long enough to impart some useful information. The player can also use the Salts to give their own health a temporary boost.
Goggles
These can be used to see the trails left behind by large concentrations of Essence. Creatures that have been energised may not be visible at the time, but the player will be able to see the paths they have taken.

Weapons
Blunderbuss
Range: 20m

Damage: 6-12 in area

Rounds: 1

Reload: 2 sec

This early version of the shotgun is particularly effective against tight groups of opponents as the pellets it discharges spread out the further they travel. Unfortunately, this spreading action also results in quite a short effective range.
Crowbar
Range: 0m

Damage: 2-8

Rounds: n/a

Reload: n/a

Not only useful for bashing opponents over the head but quite handy for bursting chains and opening crates, the crowbar is slightly clumsy and prone to slipping from the player’s grasp at inopportune moments.
Bowie Knife
Range: 0m

Damage: 4-10

Rounds: n/a

Reload: n/a

With only a short but sturdy blade, the Bowie Knife’s main use is in close combat.
Gattling Gun
Range: 30m

Damage: 5-15

Rounds: 120

Reload: 3sec

Wildly inaccurate when not mounted, the incredible rate of fire of this weapon makes it a force to be reckoned with.

Gladius
Range: 0m

Damage: 1-8

Rounds: n/a

Reload: n/a

An Ancient Roman short sword, this weapon has undoubtedly seen better days but is still useful in a pinch.
Glave
Range: 2m

Damage: 2-10

Rounds: n/a

Reload: n/a

A primitive blade but cunningly attached to a long stick. This weapon has the added advantage of keeping your opponent at a suitable distance to avoid retaliation.
Peacemaker
Range: 20m

Damage: 4-12

Rounds: 6/12

Reload: 2/3 sec

The gun that won the west, this formidable weapon is surprisingly accurate with little of the wrist breaking recoil of its predecessors. Can be used with one in each hand.
Winchester
Range: 40m

Damage: 4-12

Rounds: 12

Reload: 4 sec (or partial)

Exceptional range, firing rate and accuracy make this is a particularly fine weapon. Can be difficult to handle in close quarters.


Hybrid Technology
As many of the Baron’s inventions are based on his own scientific experience as well as the Illuminati’s arcane knowledge many of these items will have a familiar visual style. Ornately engraved brass work and polished woods with glass panels and levers. These objects are not only functional but exquisite works of art.

Many of these objects run on the same Essence that powers the Robot and can be replenished in the same way, by capturing the energy released by defeated enemies that have been animated by the Baron.
Shield Belt
Vital for the player when outside the Robot in the later stages of the game this device protects the wearer from receiving damage by expending Essence.
Energy Siphon
Developed using stolen technology, the Siphon strips Essence from people when they lose consciousness. The energy can then be stored for later use.  The Baron, who goes from city to city, followed by the player, collects the energy.
Leyden Jars
These vessels are used to store Essence for later use. Sometimes these containers leak, leaving behind trails, which can be revealed by wearing special goggles.
Energy Ray
Used by the Baron to Energise inanimate objects with stolen Essence, which he can then command to do his bidding.
Portal
This device is used by the Illuminati to bring their Reality into temporary alignment with the player’s. This allows them to cross over to aid the Baron in the fulfilment of their plans.
Unifier
The Unifier is a super-powered version of the Resonator with which the Illuminati plan to merge dimensions. The Reptilians have promised the Illuminati dominion over all the peoples of the world in exchange for their obedience. 

Scenery
Around the various locations, besides important objects that play some active part in the story, there are other items whose soul purpose is to provide set dressing.

These scenery objects range from plants and chairs, crates and ladders to mirrors and buckets. Many of these objects can be pushed, played with and depending on the weapon you are carrying, smashed and broken.

Some objects will be set up in a particular scene to be used to solve or aid in the solution to a particular puzzle in the game, these items will not be destructible. Some are there purely for aesthetic reasons, and some are there purely for the thrill of destruction. 
Triggers
The ability to attach triggers to objects and areas will add an additional dimension to the game, taking it one step on from a simple ‘walk around’ design to one that has far greater depth. This will allow our level designers to create unique puzzles, control the pace of the action and provide the player with a richer game play experience.

Triggers are not necessarily square cubes on the floor as in games of old. They could be a thin ledge that gives way under a certain amount of weight or a stone bust that opens a secret door when turned.

All triggers will have audio as well as visual feedback, so that the player will be made well aware that some change in the environment has occurred. Sometimes the trigger will require that the player be in possession of a particular object, most obviously a key, before the event will take place and may also require them to perform an Action to activate the trigger.

It is important that the graphic for these triggers should be obvious enough so that the player can identify them. They should not be invisible and therefore potentially frustrating.

Depending on the function, the trigger could also be graphically coded so that for example tiles with green moss around the corners of the give a positive result and tiles with a dead brown moss trigger a negative reaction.
Trapdoors
Walking over this trigger opens a trapdoor beneath the player, dropping them into the secret room below.
Floors Tiles
When walked over, these floor tiles ‘click’ down slightly with body weight. These triggers can be set up so that something appears, or disappears, or could simply activate the classic flying arrow trap. Some of these tiles may click to indicate their presence but will not fully activate until a sufficient amount of weight has been accumulated. These could be set up so that in a cooperative game both players have to be standing on the same tile to trigger it or that two different triggers have to be activated simultaneously, encouraging the players to properly cooperate.
Doorways
Any opening through which the player can pass could be marked as a trigger, possibly activating a Portal in the next room that spews a torrent of Illuminati or perhaps dropping a portcullis, trapping them.

VISUAL STYLE
As the game is set in the late 1800’s many of the buildings and structures that play a part in the unfolding plot will only recently have been completed. Indeed, the Statue of Liberty has not yet been finished and it will be a few more years before construction of the Eiffel Tower even begins.

Because of this the game will have a freshly painted look to many of the interiors at odds with recent trends towards dull greys and monochrome palettes. This is not to say that the game will be garish, more that the colour combinations used will reflect a more opulent time when luxurious really meant luxurious. The interior of the museum for example, will have mahogany panels and stained glass skylights spilling down on marble floors.

The environments will not be overly realistic but shall instead present an idealised version of a reality that never really existed, the Scientific Romances of Jules Verne, HG Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs, similar in tone to Disney’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea using polished brass, dark woods and plush velvet.

As a reference for the various mechanisms and devices picture the Time Machine from George Pal’s 1960 version of the story.

In order to present a suitably chilling atmosphere dramatic lighting will be used throughout. Ambient values will be kept low to provide areas of deep shadow providing a sense of menace that will contrast strongly with brightly lit windows and artificial lighting. 

The form of gas lighting used at the time gave a strong yellow cast to the surroundings. This will be replicated to give a historical, sepia tone quality to some scenes.

Characters will have a slightly stylised look similar to fighting games such as Soul Calibre and Dead Or Alive where a fairly realistic physique is used and the character wears a definite costume, which usually has two or three important visual features.

AUDIO ENVIRONMENT
Music
Background music will be themed to the specific location currently being explored. An orchestral score is being considered but should lean towards the ambient. Like Peter and the Wolf the main characters will have themes that accompany their appearance and a more strident style will be adopted during combat and exciting set pieces.
Speech
The main storyline will be narrated with region specific subtitles and important cut-scenes will be voiced accordingly. In game interaction between characters will take place in a purely text based interface to reduce the amount of audio required for multiple conversational threads.
Effects
The highly sophisticated sound processing available on next generation consoles will be utilised to its fullest to present an environment that will envelop the player.

All spot effects will be post processed to give them a special location and to match them to the current situation.

Sewers have tight echoes fading quickly beneath the constant sound of dripping water. Screams will reverberate around the hard surfaces inside the museum. Plush carpets and thick curtains will dampen echoes.

Ambient effects will be used to elevate tension and to indicate approaching danger.

TECHNOLOGY
E2os, Edgies tried and trusted technology libraries have been developed over the course of a number of projects and will form the basis for the visual, audio and control systems implemented for The Sleeping Cities.

As games hardware becomes more sophisticated the ability to amaze the player becomes more commonplace with certain effects and features only being notable by their absence. With an already sound foundation to work from we will be striving to incorporate some truly breathtaking effects.
Reflections
Illuminati will feature reflective surfaces in many locations. These will all be flat surfaces and the effect will predominantly feature on floors, as this is where it will have the greatest visual impact.

The reflection will show characters and creatures as well as the environment and will vary in its intensity to simulate a variety of different surface types, from dull, scuffed wood to the mirror like sheen of still water.

It will be possible to mask off areas of the surface to aid in the authentic portrayal of different materials.
Swirling Mist
This effect will simulate dry ice, partially obscuring the ground in certain areas. Its most notable aspect will be its reaction to the movement of characters and creatures, swirling behind them like the wake that follows a boat.
Head Turn
The characters head will turn to indicate objects or areas of particular interest to the player. This will be used to provide subtle hints to the player as to the most appropriate course of action in a given situation and to indicate particular points of interest.

PLAY SAMPLES


Museum Foyer
The marble floors, Doric columns, vaulted ceilings and gold fittings all contribute to the sense of scale, pomp and pageant that the museum has been built with and the attention to detail of a very grand design.

This Foyer is the Hub of this section of the London episode. All the other parts of the Museum return the player here in one way or another. 

The Foyer is oblong in shape, with large rotating entrance doors at one end. Across the open floor are two sets of large brass doors, which lead to separate areas of the museum. Two smaller corridors lead to the left and right.

The end of the Foyer has a sweeping staircase that runs up the rear wall, turning to continue up to a balcony on the second floor. There is a red cord strung across the bottom of the staircases indicating that they are currently out of bounds. There is a desk at the right hand side of the room, a reading light is on but nobody is there.

Lighting inside the Foyer is provided by natural light from the glass roof above. Unlit gas lanterns are positioned around the base of each of the huge pillars supporting the roof.

The player can explore the Foyer and will find information on some of the Museums main exhibits and their location. Fantastic Animals and Famous Expeditions are downstairs. There is also a sign for Ancient Costumes and a Travelling Exhibit from China, which is on the third floor. The player can examine these signs by standing in front of them and pressing the Action button.

Trying to go up the stairs will momentarily rouse the security guard who is sleeping, stretched out on a nearby wooden bench. He shouts in a sleepy voice “No. No go...No there... Zzzzzzz”, as his chin returns to his chest and the snoring resumes.

Of the two back doors, only the one on the right door has a crack of light issuing from underneath, prompting the player to push on the right hand half of the tall doors which slowly opens inward.
Animal Kingdom 1
This is Animal Kingdom, which when completed will be a macabre place of stuffed beasts from a variety of mysterious locations. The floor space is fairly limited as around the outside of the room there are six-foot high fully enclosed glass cabinets. Most are still empty although there are a few pelicans that the new taxidermist learned his trade on.

Nothing of note is going on in this room, so the player can continue ahead into through the partition.
Animal Kingdom 2
This room is similar in size and scale, but the contents here all have four legs, wolves with the skin of their upper jaw stretched and stapled into permanent snarls. A brass sign on some of the display cases, give hints and tips to the player on how best to deal with these beasts if they are stuck in the Jungle with them and have only have a pencil and a pocket watch for defence. As the player approaches the far door, the gas lanterns start to flicker slightly.
Pentagram
The third room that the player enters, is noticeably different, both in size and scale. It is a large boxed arena that acts as a mini hub for the Animal Kingdom. Each wall has a door leading to smaller, more refined areas of the exhibition. These doors are different in design to those previously encountered with slotted bars, similar in style to a prison cell door. They are all locked with a padlock. The door behind the player has just creaked slowly but solidly shut. 

Glass cabinets stand in each corner of the room and all have a notice attached, “YETI – Mystery of the World”. Within the cabinets the displays are semi complete, with wax works of hunters in tracking and firing poses. The Yetis are not yet in the displays.

The floor is a fancy grey and white marble affair with gold and aqua markings in the patterns running round the circumference of the room. The centrepiece of the floor is a pentagram etched into the marble and painted gold. Light streams in from the ceiling above enticing the player to enter the Pentagram’s clutches. 

When the player steps onto the Pentagram, the screen shrinks to indicate a cut scene is in progress. The camera rotates slowly around the player as the Pentagram starts to emit shafts of light. The light outside the circle dims and strange shapes can be seen moving in the darkness.

The screen size returns to normal and the player has a moment to prepare before the Illuminati attack.

Once the creatures have been defeated the player the contrast in the rooms colours return, only now with a shallow aqua/blue smoky glow. The sound is also different, with less echo giving a muffled claustrophobic sense. Scratching can be heard from the stairway leading to the basement. 

If the player checks the glass cases they will notice that one of the waxwork hunters is armed with a Blunderbuss and ammunition, which they can acquire by smashing the glass. The other wooden cabinets contain stone elephants.
Basement
In the basement the player discovers several eight-foot high crates. One of the crates is open. Packing straw lies strewn about on the floor nearby. Beside the crate the player will find a crowbar, which they can pick up using the Action button. Picking up the crowbar triggers an attack as several creatures burst from their crates.
 
The Yetis lumber heavily towards the player swinging wild blows with their huge arms. They charge and retreat in a manner similar to mountain gorillas. If the player found the Blunderbuss in the room above they can now use it to deal with the reanimated creatures. Otherwise they will have to make do with the crowbar.

Leaving the basement, the player ascends a flight of stairs, which lead to a padlocked door. By using the crowbar the player can burst open the lock. A short animation plays to show the character in action and the door swings open. 
Mysterious Beasts
This sub-section of Animal Kingdom, called ‘Mysterious Beasts’, is devoted to the more exotic creatures in the museums collection.

This room is large, with three rows glass cases dividing the room into sections. Through the glass the player can see several Illuminati moving in to attack. The Illuminati will try and corner the player and use their superior numbers to their best advantage.

The player must dodge round the cases trying to get some space in which to work. If things get too tight the player can burst through the glass cases to escape into the next row. If the player rushes onward they will find themselves in a more spacious room where the Illuminati will be easier to deal with.

The only item of note is a freight elevator that is stopped on the floor above. There is no way to call it down. 

In the next room a narrow staircase leads to the floor above. The staircase is too narrow for the Robot so the player must leave the Robot behind and climb the stairs.

Without the Robot the player is particularly vulnerable so this section is much more about stealth and avoidance.

Eventually the player locates the elevator and brings it to the floor below. They can now climb back aboard the Robot and use the elevator to reach the floor above.
Shadow
It is made obvious that this is a special room by the short cut-scene that accompanies the opening of the extra large doors. Deep growling noises can be heard as the camera shows a series of close ups of jet black body parts.

The view returns to normal revealing six grand pillars in the centre of the room and a ceiling of stained glass. 

The camera now takes a position behind the player looking across the room to an area of deep shadow. From that area two red eyes emerge followed by the rest of the shadow creature as it separates from the surrounding darkness.

The control of the main character is now in Set Piece mode where the analogue stick now makes the character walk forward/back and side step left and right. The character now always faces directly towards the Shadow, similar in style to numerous fighting games such as “Tekken” or “Dead or Alive” where the characters rotate around each other.

The Shadow will begin to walk through the pillars towards the player, smashing his feet down as he moves his mighty weight around the room.  Trails of dust, knocked loose, fall from the ceiling above.

The Shadow’s main method of attack is energy beams fired from its eyes. If the player is struck they will be knocked off their feet and will take significant damage. Any shots that miss will smash sections out of the scenery.

Approaching too close to the Shadow will result in a massive blow to the player, smashing them across the room. Attacking with a hand-to-hand weapon does little damage and firing any guns is similarly ineffectual as indicated by the Shadow’s health bar. The player should notice, however, that any of the Shadow’s wayward shots that hit the central pillars result in a loss of health.

The only way to get rid of the Shadow is for the player to jump back and forth between the pillars, luring the Shadow into firing towards them. Each blast of energy that hits the pillars results in more and more. When a pillar has taken enough damage, it will crumble to the floor and some of the roof above will give way.

When the final pillar is taken out a section of the roof will give way under the strain, crashing down on the Shadow and crushing it out of existence.

A victory cut scene plays with the player walking over to the rubble then posing on top of it. The screen flashes white as a picture is being taken which appears as the cover of a local newspaper with a suitable headline.

The player’s controls have now returned to Free Range mode and they can escape the room through a hole torn in the wall by the collapsing ceiling.

Once out on the Balcony the player can descend to the Foyer to find that the desk, which was empty, is now resident with a Researcher. Walking to the Researcher allows a dialogue sequence to play pointing the player in the right direction to continue their adventure.
