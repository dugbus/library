# Baldies Redux

Overview

Outline

Baldies DS is a fun easy to learn strategy game where players create and expend‭ ‬4‭ ‬types of unit in an effort to defeat their opponents.

Story

The Baldies inhabited the lushest and greenest part of their crescent shaped world until the nefarious Hairies tricked them into thinking a giant meteor was going to land and crush them all.‭ ‬The Baldies evacuated their homeland in a fleet of hastily constructed rafts but a great storm rose up and scattered the Baldies all along the coast of the inland sea.‭ ‬The player must lead the Baldies as they journey back to reclaim their homeland from the clutches of the Hairies.

Cut Scenes

Presented in a more flash style with still images sliding around and changing size/orientation.

Introduction

Exterior‭ ‬-‭ ‬a lonely windswept mountain top,‭ ‬perched on the summit is the famous Mount Bald Observatory,‭ ‬home to the Big Eye Telescope.

Interior‭ ‬-‭ ‬a lone‭ ‬Scientist seen from behind as he lazes in‭ ‬a chair,‭ ‬feet up on a desk.‭ ‬The desk is covered in screens and other instruments.

Close up‭ ‬-‭ ‬a red Warning Light begins flashing and a klaxon sounds.

The Baldy sits up and turns towards the light.

Close up‭ ‬-‭ ‬radar screen‭ ‬below the warning light‭ ‬shows the‭ ‬Baldy‭ ‬world at the centre and a large blob moving towards it.

The red light reflects on the Baldies face,‭ ‬eyes wide in terror.‭ ‬The Baldy‭ ‬knocks his chair out of the way and hurries over to the eyepiece of the telescope.

Forced perspective‭ – ‬down from telescope lens towards Baldy with his distorted eye visible in lens.‭ ‬Eye blinks.

Telescope POV‭ – ‬starfield pans left to reveal a giant meteor trailing smoke.

Cut to a close up of the Scientist looking frightened.

Scientist runs to door.‭ ‬Papers flutter in his wake.

Door slams closed behind him.

Pan up‭ – ‬to emergency exit sign above door.‭ ‬Running man but Baldy style.‭ ‬Hold.

Cut to‭ – ‬giant meteor looking fake

Stepped rotate‭ – ‬reveals Hairie hanging from balloon holding meteor cut out and smoke belching from ass.‭ ‬Or could be a squadron hiding behind much larger cut-out.

The first time each new terrain type is encountered there would be a short sequence showing Baldies on rafts arriving.

Interface


Control

Players use the stylus to interact with units on screen.‭ ‬The main window,‭ ‬which shows the game world,‭ ‬can be scrolled using either the d-pad or the four action buttons‭ (‬double tap to go to nearest house in that direction‭)‬.‭ ‬When‭ ‬either of the shoulder buttons is held the view‭ ‬swaps,‭ ‬bringing‭ ‬the‭ ‬contents of the second screen down onto the main screen where the user can interact with it.‭ ‬The content of the second screen depends on context.‭ ‬With nothing selected the second screen will generally show the‭ ‬world‭ ‬map providing an overview of the entire playing area.‭ ‬Tapping the world‭ ‬map when it is on the main display will move the user’s view to that area.‭ ‬When a building is selected the second screen shows the number of units of each type that are in that house,‭ ‬which inventions are in progress etc.

When you select a unit a thought bubble shows what’s on its mind.‭ ‬Might give a clue to what’s near by.‭ ‬Like if it saw a skunk recently.‭ ‬Units with something important to tell you would stop and wave and be indicated on the world map.

Go Action

Units that have collected an item have a go action that sends them directly to the nearest Science House‭?‬ Or units can be told what type of object to be on the lookout for.

Selecting and Targeting


Option‭ ‬1

Units have‭ ‬momentum when moving in a particular direction and are attracted towards various elements on the game map.‭ ‬Stroking across them with the stylus influences them to move in that direction.‭ ‬Stroking more gives them more inertia in the direction of the stroke.

Option‭ ‬2

Touching a Baldy with the stylus causes them to stop.‭ ‬The user‭ ‬then drags the cursor in the direction the user wants the Baldy to walk.‭ ‬Ending the movement of the stylus on a house or object will cause the Baldy to enter/use the target.

Option‭ ‬3

Touching the screen with the cursor causes a selection circle to grow out from the point of contact.‭ ‬All units within the circle when the stylus is released are selected.‭ ‬The user then taps again to target the selected units.‭ ‬Double tapping a unit of a specific type selects all units of that type that are currently on screen.‭ ‬Selected units stop and wave until given instructions.

Option‭ ‬4

Paint sunlight where you want your units to go.‭ ‬Push units to make them move in a specific direction.

Option‭ ‬5

We had an idea before where you could take possession of a unit and control it directly.‭ ‬Other nearby units would follow the possessed unit and imitate it or it could whistle to attract their attention.‭ ‬Could use the buttons or lead it with the stylus.‭ ‬Runs when it’s far away,‭ ‬walks when it’s near.

Option‭ ‬6

Draw paths/arrows on the screen for units to follow.

Cloak

Limit visibility to the vicinity of your units or buildings‭?‬ Anecdotal evidence from Advance Wars suggests casual players don’t like it.

Power Bars

Show population numerically rather than bars.‭ ‬Could have a team health bar that shows how healthy all your remaining units are.

Level Select

World map showing different terrain types with flags for each level.

Units


Types


Workers

Find and collect inventions and explore.‭ ‬Can fish if they are near the water.‭ ‬Fish improve invention speed or team health.

Builders

Make and maintain/repair houses and other structures.

Soldiers

Attack enemies outside and attack and defend buildings.

Scientists

Build and deliver inventions.

Sergeants

Cheap but overhead icon could differentiate units made in upgraded buildings.‭ ‬Or upgraded buildings could just produce faster.

Tribes


Baldies

Nomadic wanderers who lost their homeland in a giant meteor strike they travel through‭ ‬strange lands in search of a place to settle.

Cavies/Stonies

Un-evolved throwbacks to a more primitive time,‭ ‬their technology is unsophisticated but effective‭ (‬and brutal‭)‬.

Devils

Live in the hot land where they work their nefarious machinations.

Foos/Martians

Grey skinned aliens with advanced mind control technology.

Girlies

Long haired amazons

Hairies/Monkies

The arch enemies of the Baldies,‭ ‬they tricked the Baldies into leaving their homeland with tall tales of an impending meteor strike and then moved into the vacated buildings.

Momos

Inhabitants of the frozen north the Momos have developed ice technology and live in reinforced igloos.

Pharies

Inhabitants of the sandy desert,‭ ‬Pharies rely on wood and stone to get the job done.‭ ‬Their thick walled buildings and pyramids are very resistant to attack.

Subbies

Live in the deep lakes.

Yetis

Extreme mountain version of the Hairies.

Houses


Build Mechanism

To build a house costs say‭ ‬5‭ ‬builders,‭ ‬you place a build marker and it has a number above which is the number of builders you have to target there to get the building completed.‭ ‬As each builder arrives they disappear and the counter ticks down‭ (‬Pikmin style‭)‬.‭ ‬You could use the same mechanism to place inventions.‭ ‬You put down the invention marker‭; ‬it has a number of scientists required counter above it,‭ ‬one for small inventions,‭ ‬more for powerful inventions.

Build locations could be limited to held territory to slow expansion and stop sneaky Dark Planet watch tower antics.

House Panel

Grossest simplification I can think of is to not have it at all.‭ ‬If Barracks make soldiers,‭ ‬Labs make scientists,‭ ‬Factory/Workshop makes builders and Breeder house makes workers it stops being necessary.‭ (‬Except to have soldiers for defence although they could be outside and choosing which inventions to research‭)

House panel could show upgrade options.‭ ‬A big upgrade button for example.

Houses could have a target where created units will head to.

Damaged Buildings

Damaged buildings produce units more slowly until they fall below a threshold where no more units are produced.‭ (‬25%‭ ‬health‭)

Damaged buildings are indicated on the‭ ‬world map and a symbol floating above them,‭ ‬showing the number of Builders needed to repair them.

Buildings could wear out over time.

How does the player make a building if they have no Builders‭?

Repair

To repair a damaged building,‭ ‬send a builder.‭ ‬When he arrives he disappears and x points of damage are fixed.‭ ‬Could use the build mechanism where a simple number above indicates the number of builders required to completely repair the house.

Buildings


Breeder house

Produces Worker units.‭ ‬Units get spat out in a random direction to prevent door trapping.

Factory/Workshop

Produces Builder units.

Laboratory

Produces Scientists and researches inventions.

Barracks

Produces soldiers and ammunition.

Watchtower

Defends territory.

Inventions


Activation

How to turn on new inventions‭?

Finding objects in the environment and transporting them to a science house could activate them.

A larger population turns on more advanced inventions‭?

Use

Unit specific inventions are used as needed,‭ ‬like Snorkel.‭ ‬Sending a unit into the water uses one Snorkel from the pool.‭ ‬No need to equip it first.‭

Types


Air Conditioning/Gas Mask

Reduces the effects of the skunk bomb in houses.

Aqualung

Allows units to travel through water as it was land.

Angel Cloud

Changes the team of units that fly through it.‭ ‬Could also be a ground based version.

Balloon

Balloons are shiny and draw Baldies and members of the opposing team towards them but they don’t last forever.‭ ‬Eventually they burst,‭ ‬frightening and causing damage to all the entranced Baldies in the vicinity.‭ ‬Flying Baldies lose their concentration and fall to the ground.

Bubblizer

Encases target units in a bubble and they float away.

Bullets

Power-up for soldier units.

Cannons

Cannons can be used by the user to move their Baldies over obstacles and as traps by targeting them on fatal areas like water.‭ ‬Members of the opposing teams will not be able to resist climbing in if they pass close by.

Catapult

Throws units into the air.

Decoy

Looks like an invention pickup but is a booby trap.

Exploding Cow

Gas in the cow ignites causing a spiral of flame and destruction.

Earmuffs/Wax

Stops enemy units from hearing orders.

Earthquake

Shakes buildings causing damage to them and the ground.‭ ‬Units flee buildings in the affected area.

Electro

Static discharge shocks those who touch it.‭ ‬Enhanced by rain.

Gas Cloud

Causes units in the effected area to fall asleep.‭ ‬Drift could be affected by wind.‭ ‬Sleeping units dream of flowers.‭ ‬Or dream of inventions and when woken turn into them.

Fertility Plus/Minus

Increases/decreases unit production in the targeted house.

Firebomb

Ignites targeted unit.‭ ‬Advanced version affects an area.

Fish Rain

Units eat the fish that falls from the sky,‭ ‬regaining health.

Flowers

Attract units to a specific area.‭ ‬Could be something else shiny.

Grenades

Power up for soldier units.

Hive

Produces a swarm of bees that chase all the enemy‭? ‬Units out of the area.

Interloper

Disguise one of your units to look like the enemy so you can spy in enemy territory.‭ ‬He gives himself away by not obeying enemy orders.

Landmine/Minefield

Not sure if these are so funny anymore.

Mass Paga

Big fight.‭ ‬Could make it an area of effect rather than a game ending shortcut.

Pit

Swallows up the unsuspecting.

Popper/Popperfield

Inflates units that come in contact with it.‭ ‬Units could float away before bursting or there could be a separate floaty invention.

Rock Rain

Chunks fall from the sky making it difficult to build in that area and injuring units.

Shark Bait/Repellent

Shark Bait attracts the famous and incredibly hungry land shark to an area.‭ ‬Any Baldies or members of the opposing team in the area are liable to be snapped up and dragged down.

Sickness/Zombiefication

Infects an enemy unit who can then infect others.‭ ‬Infected characters don’t obey orders and don’t contribute to energy bars.‭ ‬You can kill them to halt the spread of the infection or invent a cure.

Skunk Bomb

The stink causes units to evacuate a building could be used outside to clear an area.

Snorkel

Allows units to cross water.

Stealth

Makes units and/or houses invisible to the enemy.‭ ‬Disrupted by weather.‭

Storm

Covers the ground in impassable puddles.

Teleport

Transports units to distant locations.

Turbo

Makes units move much more quickly.

Vacuum

Speeds up object collection transporting them directly to the science lab.

Maps


Terrain

As well as ground,‭ ‬trees and water we could have un-editable rocky areas to shape the levels or the long in development cliffs.

Terrain Types


Grassy‭ (‬Green‭)

Lush grassland with broad leafed trees.

Arctic‭ (‬White‭)

Snowy wastes with only pine trees for shelter.

Desert‭ (‬Brown‭)

Lots of sand with occasional palm trees and oases.

Hell/Mordor

Skin and bones or swampy and unpleasant.

Prehistoric

Lava and weird fossilised trees.

Diversity

Make levels play differently by having different objectives and limiting the inventions available.‭ ‬If the inventions are activated by finding objects on the map then it is straightforward to control availability.‭ ‬For each level have a set number of each object placed on the map.‭ ‬Once one has been collected,‭ ‬spawn a replacement somewhere else on the map.‭ ‬This would keep things moving and stop Fat Chris from dumping all the skunks in the water.‭ ‬The object would have to spawn away from the player’s current viewport.

Exploration

If each invention had a map object associated with it,‭ ‬the player would have a reason to explore the map,‭ ‬to find the different inventions,‭ ‬similar to the way rocks and the animals work now.‭ ‬They could require a certain number of workers to collect them.‭ (‬Find and take back,‭ ‬or just find‭?) ‬Plus the level designer could limit which inventions were available by having them not be on the map.‭ ‬This approach would remove the confusion about which house you build to get what invention.‭ ‬Multiplayer maps could have semi random placements of pickups to make them less predictable.‭ ‬You could have mystery pickups that you don’t know what they are until you collect them.
