# Alien Sheep Dogs

Stroke control for direction and speed but you have 3 dogs that you can position/move. The sheep/aliens/whatever are repulsed by the dogs so you use them to move the aliens through the level avoiding traps, drops, predators etc

The sheep are not totally stupid and will avoid some of the obvious threats but pressure from other sheep, dog too close could force them over a cliff.

Alternative control means holding the dog all of the time. Like finger twister.

There will be areas that only the sheep can go through so the player has to take the dog around a circuitous route.

There are gates on the course that only sheep of a particular colour can go through so you have to force your sheep through a spray booth to change them to that colour.

We can also do numbered gates for speed runs where you only have to get above a certain number of sheep through. A counter above the gate counts down as the sheep pass through.

For years aliens have been stealing our sheep and now we know why. To use them in herding competitions. Because nothing gets herded like a sheep.

So the dogs won’t be dog’s. I picture a cartoony kind of octopus thing.

It would be cool if we could have gradient lines or something on the landscape that influence the sheeps direction. Like hillsides that real sheep roam on.
