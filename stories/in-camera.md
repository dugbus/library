# In Camera

Perched on the top of Biggin Hill like a cherry on a cake sits the house where Katie lives. The thick walls of the old farm building support a slate tiled roof that slopes up to a huge, Santa friendly chimney and the strange arrangement of bird perches that Katie’s Dad once told her collect television pictures and sound from out of the air.

The windows hang open to let in the warm summer air allowing the curtains from Katie’s room to escape outside where they flap softly in the breeze. Next to the house is a barn made from rickety wood that is big enough to hold a bus.

The grass on the lawn is trampled in circles where Katie, her hair an untidy halo in the late afternoon sun, runs round and round trying to catch up with her new friend.

“Please be still Mr Butterguy. You can’t be famous if I don’t take your picture.” She whirls round, finger poised on the button of her brother’s old film camera, as her subject flits obliviously through the air. She does her best to follow, the camera bobbing up and down in time to his flutters but every time she is about to click, the wind or his obstinance carry him away.

Katie has pictures of nearly all of the interesting things near her house, which she keeps in an old shoebox under her bed. Her mother has promised to buy her an album for her birthday so she can arrange them all in it. To some people the pictures might not look very special but each of them is important to Katie in one way or another.

She sighs loudly in frustration, shaking her head as Mr Butterguy finally comes to rest on a flower with red petals almost the size of his wings.

“Not those again. That colour doesn’t suit you at all.” Katie lowers the camera and leans forward to blow gently on his wings. “Fly to the yellow one. Yellow is your favourite colour. And it is the prettiest.” The butterfly’s wings flicker at the touch of her breath but he stays where he is. His long tongue unrolling as he begins to lick nectar from the heart of the flower.

Katie is on the gentle slope on the left hand side of the drive that leads to her house, near the concrete pond with its fishy fountain where the Pygmy Whale lives. There is no fence on this side of the garden but at the bottom of the hill, just after the trees peter out, a little stream marks its end. The land on the far side is covered in food for the huge machines that Katie is never, ever to go near.

Mr Butterguy hops in the air again and Katie sets off in pursuit. She has spent most of the afternoon, after getting home from school, trying to catch him on film. But all she has to show for her efforts so far are two pictures of clouds dancing and one with blurry streaks of grass and a thumb. Her mother says the special film for her camera is expensive and becoming hard to find so she must do her best not to waste any more.

Katie is so intent on her quarry that she doesn’t realise how far she has wandered into the woods until an exposed root brings her tumbling to the ground. Fortunately she manages to land on her back to protect the precious camera, which she examines carefully for damage. Satisfied, she lies for a moment staring up through the translucent leaves, the blue sky shimmering with green as the branches flex in the breeze.

Katie rolls over onto her knees, holding the camera in one hand, and hops up into a crouch. She peers into the dappled gloom of the deeper woods like a hunter stalking her prey.

“Where are you hiding, Mr Butterguy?”

She begins to stalk forward, still half crouching, looking slowly from side to side, searching for any hint of movement but the woods here seem to be asleep. She stops and puts her hand against the soft bark of the nearest tree, feeling it give a little as she gently presses. Looking up, the branches appear much thicker, blocking out most of the sky from view.

Katie gives a little shiver. It is certainly much colder now that she is out of the sun. She moves away from the tree and stands very still, listening now more than looking. Her head cocked to one side. Far away the faint sighs of the stream, some bird song back towards the house, and something else almost too faint to hear. Like the murmur of voices and soft laughter at night she used to hear before her Father went away.

Creeping round an especially large trunk she comes upon a magnificent sight. Sleeping in the centre of a clearing in the trees is an ancient Wood Dragon. His long cylindrical body half buried and covered by moss and lichen. Tiny tattered wings of green stick out at odd angles all along his length. Katie moves carefully around so she can better see the long curve of his head and the stumpy fore legs crossed beneath his chin. They are not dangerous creatures if you are polite but you wouldn't want one to sit on top of you. And never climb into their mouths voluntarily.

Katie raises her camera, almost shaking with excitement and not a little bit of trepidation. Pop goes the flash, flooding the clearing with light and dark shadows. All the colours bleached for a moment. The startled dragon’s mouth opens wide and he belches forth a tumble of coloured shapes, like confetti from a clown's gun. It takes Katie a moment to realise a rabble of butterflies are rolling towards her.

"Help," Katie cries, ducking and turning to avoid a collision with the spray of fluttering wings. Her free hand waves madly in the air to keep them out of her hair. For a moment she feels the gentle caress of the wind from their wings on her back and bare arms but they pass quickly over, the cloud beginning to disperse. She chooses one to follow but almost as soon as she has settled on it, it seems to disappear and another catches her eye. Katie spends frantic seconds dashing this way and that her camera half raised and at the ready before finally following a blue butterfly round a tree and realising they have all gone.

The ancient Wood Dragon has settled back into his slumber and Katie thinks that disturbing it again would not be the best of ideas. She exhales a quiet, “Oh” and after one last hopeful look round she begins to walk back towards the house.

At the edge of the wood, close to the hole of the elusive Mole Frog, Katie sees the clump of yellow flowers where she had hoped to immortalise the butterfly and is just about to aim a kick in their general direction when a flicker of movement catches her eye.

Perched on the front of her camera is her elusive subject, Mr Butterguy. She raises the camera very slowly and peers through the eyepiece. The butterfly is monstrously large. Definitely not his best angle. It seems from Katie’s perspective that he’s trying to lick her eyeball. Quickly extending the camera and butterfly to arm’s length she winks away the imagined touch his proboscis. “You are very confused, Mr Butterguy. This is not a flower.” Katie lowers the camera and tips it back slightly so that she can see its passenger more clearly. Holding her breath tightly she begins to tip-toe carefully towards the yellow flowers.

Honk!

Suddenly and too close for comfort, she recognises the obnoxious air horn of her brother’s car as he turns into the driveway. She jumps a little but the butterfly doesn’t seem to mind, remaining firmly in position, engrossed in his own distorted reflection. She turns to watch as the car hisses up the gravel drive towards the house. Through the reflected sky on the tinted windows she can just make out her brother and his special friend Tina, the Skinny Witch.

A worried look crosses Katie's face as she resumes her careful journey to the yellow flowers with as much urgency as her speed will allow. Behind her she hears the car crunch to a stop in front of the house then the engine go quiet and two doors open and close. She lowers herself carefully to one knee then the other. Only one problem remains, the transfer of Mr Butterguy to a suitable perch. She knows from experience that blowing doesn’t work so perhaps if she nudges him gently with the petals of a flower he will get the message. She is just leaning forward to begin this delicate operation when she hears her brother close behind her.

"If you’ve finished playing with the camera I need to use it now."

"I am not playing. This is my profession," Katie replies, indignant, as she tries once more to persuade Mr Butterguy to disembark.

"Katie, you’re rubbing it against a flower. I may not be the best photographer in the world but I'm pretty sure that's not how it's done."

"He's ready now please be quiet."

Katie raises the camera to her eye and adjusts the focus, bringing Mr Butterguy into sharp relief against the yellow petals. He turns a little on the spot and his wings flicker open to reveal a marvellous pattern.

Click.

"Bad word!" Katie protests as her brother pulls the camera away.

"You got your picture now I have to take some of my own," he replies, turning back towards the house where the Skinny Witch waits.

"Probably all I got was a photo of your stupid fat hand. Let me take another please." But her brother is already striding away, camera held aloft as a sign of his success. “Stay there Mr Butterguy. I’ll be back,” Katie says with more optimism than she feels, but he doesn’t seem to care.

Katie runs to catch up with her brother, "Please Michael, just one more." He doesn't reply but moves the camera into his left hand and gently palms her away when she makes a grab for it. Laughing he waves the camera at his girlfriend while Katie dances round him in frustration.

"Alright then lets get this show on the road." Katie's brother stops near the front of his car, waiting while his girlfriend finishes putting on her lipstick.

"Where do you want me honey?" she asks.

"How about right here on the hood of my car."

Katie pouts as the Skinny Witch slides up onto the front of the car and drapes herself across the bonnet. Katie isn't even allowed to touch her brother's car but she gets to sit right on top of it. There is no justice.

Michael starts taking photographs, trying to strike a balance between flattering his girlfriend and getting enough of his car in each shot to keep himself happy. Katie looks on in disgust. Dismayed by the number of precious exposures he is getting through.

"Watch the paint work baby. Maybe we should try it without the heels."

Katie goes to stand by her brother eager to be included in some manner but he bumps and brushes past her as he moves to find a better framing.

"Take some of me Michael?" Katie pleads, tugging at his sleeve.

But the Witch replies for him, "Forget about it Kiddo, there's only one model on this shoot."

"Don’t call me that," Katie shrieks, “I have a name,” with stamping foot, “and I can sit on a car better than you.”

Fuming with anger and frustration Katie looks towards the barn but quickly turns away. "Now is not the time," she mutters under her breath.

Just as she is on the verge of having calmed down enough to retreat to the house in search of snacks, she glances up and unfortunately for all concerned catches the Skinny Witch with her tongue out pulling a face while her brother's back is turned.

This time Katie doesn't hesitate and marches off resolutely towards the barn not even detouring round one of the flower beds but instead stamping directly through it. The girlfriend smirks triumphantly assuming she has won their battle of wills.

Michael continues to take photographs of his beloved car while his girlfriend basks, oblivious to the fact that she is not the centre of his attention.

Strange whirring, whooshing noises begin to emanate faintly from the barn and an ominous glow can be seen through the gap below the door. Then all is silence.

The door of the barn swings slowly open but Katie's brother has his back to the building and does not notice the strange figure as it begins to emerge. Only the sudden change of expression on his girlfriends face alerts him that something strange is going on. He stares transfixed as she slides off the hood of the car landing on the gravel with a thump. Hearing the gravel crunch behind him he turns and comes face to visor with the thing that so surprised the Witch she forgot how to sit.

Encased in her prototype Robot Suit Katie raises one gauntleted hand and extends it palm raised. Her voice through the external speaker is tinny and distorted but definitely means business, "Camera. Now."

Katie's brother's brain seems to be having difficulty processing the situation as fourteen different expressions come and go across his face. Pistons clanking Katie steps forward forcing him to retreat. Her open hand remains extended but the other moves up to grasp the aerial extending from the boot of Michael’s prized possession. Katie's face is visible through the glass front of her helmet and her brother follows her meaningful gaze as she looks towards the aerial and then back to her brother. "Or the car gets it."

Katie's brother shakes his head moving the camera behind his back and is clearly worried by the escalating situation, "We do not deal with terrorists Katie," he explains bravely but the whine of servos engaging in the Robot Suit's arm accompany his horrified squeak as the aerial begins to bend.

Even with the volume from the external microphone set on low Michael’s cry of despair is incredibly loud. Katie reaches forward with her left gauntlet and makes a beckoning motion. Defeated Michael steps forward and places the camera like an offering in her palm. She releases the aerial, which twangs mostly back into place.

And then the Robot Suit goes dark.

The Skinny Witch emerges from the barn carrying the end of a power cable that snakes across the grass to where Katie stands now immobile. Katie frantically tries to see behind her but without power the servos in the articulated helmet neck won’t operate. Michael advances towards her with a menacing look. Katie anticipating a scolding of biblical proportions retreats as far back in the suit as is possible.

Michael says many words, in a more or less continuous stream for two full minutes. His hot breath fogging the front of the Robot Suit visor. Incidents from Katie’s younger years are brought up and perhaps a few things that happened before she was born are also included. Fortunately for her young ears in the absence of power the helmet speakers are silent. Michael’s ranting is mostly indecipherable, muffled to a Gregorian chant by the thick visor and helmet insulation.
