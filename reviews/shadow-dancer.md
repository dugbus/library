# Shadow Dancer

Set in the early 90’s as the Irish Peace Process rolls slowly forward this well constructed thriller features Clive Owen at his sad sack best. Far removed from James Bond, his agent in this story is an MI5 middle manager struggling to protect a recently turned informant, Colette McVeigh, from her own family and the machinations of his boss (Gillian Anderson).

Directed by sometime documentarian James Marsh (Project Nim, Man on Wire), Shadow Dancer, while hardly filled with event, maintains a solid sense of tension throughout as the net slowly closes on Colette.

Marsh's use of close ups, often of each actor individually, adds to the sense of isolation Colette is enduring. And the slight period setting is effectively conveyed and actually contributes to the plot. The absence of mobile phones for communication makes visits to the phone box a necessity and the only piece of high tech gadgetry in the film is comically large, and consequently difficult to hide.

Colette, played by actress Andrea Riseborough (Resistance, Brighton Rock), who, alongside co-star Brid Brennan won the Award for Best Performance in a British Feature Film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival for this role, is the main focus of the film.

She responds to her impending discovery in a very human way, alternating between panic and despair, only returning to the joys of a young mother on those rare occasions when she can forget her predicament for a few moments. Her son’s birthday is particularly affecting.

With the basis of her commitment to the cause having been undermined and with no one in her family to turn to other than one of her brothers, Connor (Domhnall Gleeson), who is also under suspicion, she develops a relationship of sorts with Owen’s character Mac.

Her other surviving brother, Gerry played by an underused Aiden Gillen, is their leader and it is his refusal to rein in his enforcer, a dogged David Wilmot playing Kevin Mulville, that leads Mac to take drastic action.

The lack of incident can sometimes leave the film feeling a little like a kitchen sink drama, albeit one where almost everyone is either a terrorist or a freedom fighter depending on your perspective. But the strength of the performances and the inherent danger of Colette’s situation carry the story to a satisfying if uncomfortable conclusion.
