# Grabbers

A remote Irish fishing community comes under attack from strange sea creatures of possibly extraterrestrial origin and as the disappearances and unattached heads pile up it is left to an alcoholic washout and an uptight Garda visiting from the city to concoct a particularly Irish plan to save the local villagers.

The film from director Jon Wright (his second feature after 2009’s similarly toned Tormented) and writer Kevin Lehane, stars Richard Coyle (Pusher) as troubled Garda Ciarán O'Shea left in charge while his superior is on holiday. Teamed up with by-the-books Dublin police woman Lisa Nolan played by Ruth Bradley (Primeval), O’Shea must overcome an alcohol problem and conviction that nothing interesting ever happens where they are to save the locals without causing panic. Russell Tovey (Being Human) lends a scientific hand as Dr Adam Smith and Lalor Roddy does his best to steal his scenes as pickled fisherman Paddy Barrett.

Once you get past the lacklustre title this charming village under siege flick entertains in a way many of its bigger budget cousins fail to. The special effects in general and the main creature in particular stand up well, even in extended shots and are genuinely creepy or amusing as the script demands.

Borrowing from a number of genre films (Tremors springs immediately to mind) but never aping them directly (apart from a clear Gremlins homage) the story proceeds in an orderly fashion but uses some great character moments to overcome the slight predictability of the plot.

The film feels long even at 94 minutes but part of its charm is that it isn’t in a rush to get anywhere. Many scenes extend past their natural conclusion but almost always reward with a few more chuckles and the main characters’ chemistry makes them easy to spend time with, even in the altered mental state they have to deal with for the last act of the story.

Grabbers is definitely a comedy first and a horror film second with plenty of amusement punctuated by bursts of shaky cam jeopardy. The set pieces sometimes feel a bit by the numbers and it would have been interesting to see the film makers adopt a similarly measured approach to the horror as they have done with the humour in order to generate more tension.

The score is occasionally intrusive and is sometimes at odds with the whimsy of the actors’ approach and would be more at home in a heavy handy yarn by someone like Spielberg having an off day.

Overall though Grabbers is a welcome addition to the modern monster bestiary excelling most when it lets the warm Irish flavour and its characters shine through.
