# My Little Fireman

Once, long ago, when I was a nipper, my parents somewhat inadvisably left me alone for a short time while they went on some errand with my infant sister. My favourite toy at the time was a tin fireman with whom I had concocted some great adventures but unfortunately there had never been a proper conflagration for my little companion to deal with.

I know where you think this story is going but thankfully no permanent damage was done. Awareness of the inherent dangers of flames had been drummed into me from an even earlier age, a necessity in a house heated by open coals, so I endeavoured to find an alternative means of simulating the fire fighting experience.

When my parents returned, I and my room, which had thankfully been stripped bare in preparation for redecoration, were covered in talcum powder, which I had used as a substitute for the billowing smoke of a four alarm blaze. Perched atop the full size ladder that my father would later use to hang the new wallpaper was my fireman, the bright colours of his uniform subdued by a thin layer of talc.

Now, however, this once happy memory always brings to mind images of the aftermath of the 9/11 New York attacks. Another small, but significant to me, casualty of the terrorist's actions.

When my sister's son was young I, assuming all small boys found firemen and their paraphernalia interesting, pointed out a speeding fire engine, lights flashing, sirens blaring to him through the window of our car. My nephew turned to me and said, with a sigh, which perfectly captured his disapproval of my excitement, "That means someone's house is on fire."
