# Death From Above

Four and a half years ago my father walked out of our lives and into a mental hospital, taking his copious plans for the Earth’s defence against alien invasion with him. Two years after that, as he sat wrapped in a blanket, glaring up at the night sky, a meteorite the size of a grape seed sizzled through his left eye and punctured the socket, destroying a small but important part of his hypothalamus. Despite the hospital’s best efforts he died two days later, his brain cooked by his body’s sudden inability to control its own temperature.

I was with him when he passed, my platitudes muffled by the surgical mask I wore to reduce the pervasive aroma of bacon. His last rasping words, as he clutched my gloved hand were, “What the fuck was I thinking?”

I am sure that is a sentiment echoed by many of the people who have squandered their last days in a futile attempt to stave off the inevitable. Of course for some of them it is a great deal more than a few days. Years wasted avoiding large dogs or peppermint ice cream or under-fives named Charlie and as far as any of us know, extending their lives by not a single second. Conversely of course, no-one can be certain that they didn’t live longer than they would have unknowing. Just because Fate or the Universe or Whoever finally off’ed them in a manner in keeping with their predicted demise doesn’t mean they didn’t manage to avoid other equally applicable endings.

It is enough to make one’s head swim, which is why I am in a bar drinking. 

Being drunk is no excuse for aberrant behaviour. At some point you were sober and made conscious decision to start drinking. If this leads to an unfortunate conclusion the responsibility is still yours.


According to my calculations there is a small but significant chance that my actions will result in the unravelling of reality.
My breath fogs the mirror as I raise the gun to my head. Fuck you Universe, I at least will write my own Ending.

Some people call it a Spoiler.

Romantics marry someone who has the same Ending hoping they’ll both go together.

Mention father’s Ending later but don’t say what it was.
Like when the army recruiters stopped accepting people who’s Ending was, “SHOT IN THE HEAD”.

What do dead people’s readings say?

Knowies and know-nots
If you don’t have a reading would that still have been the way you died.
Quantum entaglment.
Is everyone’s reading ambiguous?
Religious interpretation of reading.
Is it that only people who will die unusually that get an ambiguous reading?
