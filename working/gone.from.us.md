Thoughts On RPG X
By D Brown
The Beginning
This entire introductory segment, excepting the final shot, is in first person. Although not portrayed obviously at first, it should become evident over the course of the piece that we are viewing the world through the eyes of an intelligent entity. Think of it as one long steady-cam shot.
She Sleeps
The view drifts through an ancient forest in the twilight just before dawn, taking seemingly random interest in the occasional feature. We see in transience a little circle of mushrooms, a croaking frog and a strange insect emerging from its cocoon. Inquisitive, the view drifts on towards the dark bowl of an ancient tree. Just as it is about to enter, a low warning growl causes a sudden retreat as if scolded. Glimpsed through the foliage, a villa, where light and movement attract the curious view’s attention.
A sound nearby, the view turns quickly to see a man, hurrying along a path towards the villa. The view follows, a little shyly at first but quickly growing bold enough to move ahead and look back to examine the man. Powerfully built and armoured beneath his billowing cloak he carries an elaborate sword in the scabbard at his side, which the view lingers on. His steely blue eyes convey great concern and he wears a huge moustache. Looking towards the villa the view speeds ahead of the man.
A few servants crowd around a window and a partially open door from which the soft glow of lamplight emerges. An old woman carrying a steaming bucket of boiled water pushes through the group. The view follows her through the doorway and turns to regard her as she closes the door. She is a midwife in the grand tradition of midwifes. She hurries past the fire towards the heavily pregnant woman on the bed on the far side of the room. The view drifts up the pregnant woman to dwell on her face as the midwife mops her brow. She is in labour.
A contraction causes the view to pull back suddenly. The door opens to reveal the man. He pauses on the threshold as the view moves towards him. Looking back towards the bed the midwife goes about her duties. The man seems reluctant to approach too closely and instead paces back and forth followed by the view.
He moves forward when the midwife turns, in her arms a baby. The man stops short however, something is wrong. The child is still. Tentatively he reaches for the child. The view regards him closely. He is distraught. The midwife blocks him as he moves towards the bed.
“She sleeps.”
He turns, cradling the baby, and walks out through the doorway, visibly slumped. Outside the servants pull back. One weeps, turning to another for comfort. The third reaches towards the man but stops short. The man continues a short distance into the forest followed by the view.
He comes to rest on an overgrown marble bench. The view closes in on the infant then looks to the man, who, eyes closed, rocks gently backwards and forwards. Then it turns again to the baby. Fade out.
Darkness. Silence, broken by a baby’s cry. Cut to the man on the bench. He looks up suddenly, surprised. Cut to a close up of the gurgling child. Pull back as the man lifts the squirming infant aloft. A new dawn breaks in the background. The servants rush in celebrating. Only the midwife hangs back, troubled.
Vignettes
Memories of childhood used in flashbacks later in the story. Shown from the child’s point of view.
Chasing butterflies through the forest and coming upon a unicorn.
Toppling a pile of fruit when taking one from the bottom and being scolded.
Looking up from the crib at adults pulling faces.
The midwife lingers. We could glimpse her occasionally during play. The only one who suspects your true nature.
He Is Gone From Us Now
A stormy night, lightning flashes. A group of men approach the villa. Hammering on the door. Child POV of towering adults rushing around. The man accompanies the strangers off into the night. Day, the woman waits staring forlornly down the dusty road for a sign of his return. The child observes the lonely figure from a distance. A servant approaches and pauses,
“He is gone from us now.”
Or the child is touching something associated with the man when the servant approaches.
Welcome My Brothers
Out numbered and cornered in the forest, the villain does some gloating before dispatching you. When he pauses to draw breath, dark figures emerge from the forest, evening the odds significantly.
“Welcome My Brothers.”
Some of your other family have arrived.
The Midwife
She poisoned the woman to make sure the child was stillborn. She is in league with the villain. She’ll get her comeuppance later. Once her treachery has been uncovered.
The Villain
We need a really meaty villain, of the scenery chewing variety. Preferably with a big grudge. He could be the local lord, consumed by jealousy, angry with the man for standing up to him. He could be some kind of magic user in league with evil forces but with a secret weakness. We thwart him and he gets away a couple of times before the big showdown. Ming The Merciless.
Settings
As well as the standard Dark Ages setting of most fantasy we could also consider:
Ancient. A bit further back, peopled by mighty heroes and mythical monsters. More like Conan or Greek myth than Lord of the Rings.
Mediaeval. Involving lots of shiny armour and questing. You could start off as a squire. Druids.
Celtic Legend. Lots of source material. Horrid monsters. Bloodthirsty. Treacherous. The Cauldron of Plenty. Corum.
Horror. Ancient ones from the place between angles. Cultists and insanity.
Future. Flash Gordon style. Retro future. Swords and technocracy.
Name
When creating your character you name him/her and that name will be used in the story. The naming ceremony could be a sort of initiation at the start of the story.
Story
I think we could refer to it as a story rather than a game. The unfolding of a strong narrative will be a key feature.
Customisation
Hair. Eye colour. Build. Clothes. The main character should allow as much customisation as possible. The more it’s the player’s creation the more involved they will be. ref Phantasy Star.
Statistics
Strength, Agility, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, Magic
Cut Scenes
We should do these in engine. Seamless.
Mentors
Select a mentor when developing the character, whether that constitutes part of the story or happens beforehand. If you decide to train with the magi your ability to fight goes down but you gain magic. Train with the cutpurse and you get sneakier but more vulnerable.
Religion
Have a religious aspect, shrines, local deities. Think Egypt. Very political. The minions of Set manouvering their people into positions of power.
Grand Conspiracy
Possibly tied to religion. The Villain seeks power to enforce his religious views on the populace.
Characters Technical
Skinned meshes using skeletal animation and motion blending. Facial animation by barycentric morph target. Physics based cloth features.
Cannon Fodder
Made from interchangeable parts to provide variety.
Relics
Powerful objects left lying around. Swords. Orbs. Rings. Searching dank dungeons.
Magic
It could be interesting for everyone to have a little magic. Like Runecraft.
Non-Player Characters
Will the main character be accompanied and if he is what form will the support take. Options for the main character.
Lone gunman. Like Conan. Dredd.
With side kick. Corum and Jahred.
Part of double act. Fahfred and the Grey Mouser.
Team member. It could be interesting if you start out as a junior member in a party. The new kid. Then develop into the leaders role after your surrogate father (the group leader, not the one from the introduction) gets wiped by the villain.
Combat
One of the main things RPGers have mentioned when I asked them why they preferred this style of game was because they were easy and long. No quick reactions required. The considered approach of turn based combat. More like chess than squash. ref UFO. Personal favourite was Space Hulk, freeze time concept. The longer you played in real time the more freeze time you saved up. This allowed you to pause the action but still issue orders.
Hub Structure
Have a central base of operations. Like Lahnkmar. Each of the adventures takes you away then leads you back. There could also be adventures in the Hub, if its large enough. Also revisit places.
Scroll Map
To cover up those tedious long journeys show the long legs on a map. The player selects the route and drops out of map mode when they come across an incident. Will also help with orientation when people talk about journeying to the Fire Swamp of Salgotha before storming the Citadel of Pain, it will all make sense. The plane flight transitions in the Indy films. But not at all like the start of Dad’s Army.
Wandering Monsters
They are pants padding that we can well do without. While not every incident is vitally important to the story they should still be considered encounters which have some point. Not randomly hacking away at another gang of orcs.
Arc
The villain should turn out to be behind everything nefarious. Not all the adventures should directly involve the villain but his fingerprints should be all over the place.
Sword
Seeing the villain, or his henchman with the sword should be a big moment.
Development
There should be a definite enhancement in the players character over the course of the story. Experience. Training. They will need to be in tip-top condition for the final confrontation. This was another big point with RPGers. Getting more new abilities the longer they played. ref Soul Reaver.
The Dungeon
The villain has to pull out your long lost surrogate father, who has been languishing in a dungeon for years, at some point. It will be a big moment when he is killed helping you escape, to prepare for the final confrontation.
Getting Killed
We could develop some alternatives to this. You could be knocked unconscious and thrown in prison, or just robbed, depending on who you are fighting.
