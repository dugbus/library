# Stair

Of all the windows in my house why do I find myself staring through the smallest one the most. And not even one to the outside world. A tiny glass lens rimmed in brass providing a fisheye view of the stairwell and neighbours passing like weather?

        Of all the windows in my home, I find myself fixated on the smallest one the most. A tiny circle of steel, embedded in the door, reveals a geometric landscape of banisters and rails. I press my right eye, wide to the glass, patiently waiting for a glimpse of life in the dim light of the stairway beyond.

        I never sought this isolation but an untended connection will wither over time, like an unrecalled memory. The world and I went our separate ways, quietly, over long, slow years. My disassociation accomplished without my assistance, but, I am sad to say, with my complicity. My only connection now to those outside is this peephole, a narrow aperture at best, through which to squeeze a life.
  
While I may have been demoted from participant to observer and I would hesitate to label my observation of those outside communication, I do still, at least, feel a little part of something.
        
It is difficult though for me to grasp their motivations after all these years, time has eroded my references. So I observe their shadow play with all the insight I can muster and attempt to reconstruct whole lives from fleeting glimpses of passing phantoms, a physicist’s cloud chamber writ large in concrete and dust.
        
I hear a door below grate open, the main door to the street, judging by the sound and increase in light. There are two flats down there, one floor below, and a back door to the garden, paint blistered deep red and worn along its lower edge the last time I saw. I hope the shuffling footsteps belong to one of my neighbours and not the mysterious ground dwellers, who I have probably never seen.
        
At the foot of the stairs now and climbing, the Asian lady weighed down with shopping? The top half of her door I can see through the banister of the steps to the second floor. No, Mrs. McGhee, one of the few people whose names I am sure of, her door being directly opposite and labelled in brass. Her head now in view as she mounts the last steps to our landing, grey hair in patches leaks from her hat, stained yellow by the smoky haze that passes for air in the local bingo hall.

She’s carrying a small package, collected from the Post Office, which the postman failed to deliver, just a fraction too large for her letterbox, the stamps on it Dutch. 
She moves slowly towards her door, fishing in her bag for the jumble of keys, a lifetime’s supply, never discarded. At the door reaching up, they slip from her fingers.

        “Fuck.”

        Joints as stiff as a twice rusted gate, she bends slowly to grasp them, on the dirty straw mat she keeps by her door. She needs the handle to help her get upright, twisting it down as the key finally turns. The door opens to a moment of brown fleck and carpet then she’s gone, concealed behind wood the colour of pond scum.



on the creased tape of my memory

Something you have to use to keep it in good working order.

Like love, which is something that only exists while it is being observed.

and it’s too late in life for me to flex those atrophied muscles again

        I tried using the letterbox as my window on the world for a while but it made my knees ache and was a bit too obvious. Anyone glancing down as they passed could have seen my eyes stretched wide to drink in the experience. My adopted role of observer would be compromised if I became part of the tableaux. If you shine a light on an experiment meant to take place in darkness the outcome will be affected. It’s not that I’m doing anything wrong, you understand, but not everyone would see it that way. Some might confuse my observation with an invasion of privacy and that could lead to all sorts of contamination. So I’ll stick with the anonymous approach and keep tabs on the world through the inconsequential distortion of my fisheye lens. And before you get all sanctimonious, that landing is a public place, open to public scrutiny. It’s not as if I’m peering in next door’s window with a mirror on a stick, is it? This can’t be good for my back.

        I’d love to sit down and have a nice cup of tea but I’m trapped by my own expectations. The longer it’s quiet the more likely it is that something is just about to happen. Like a television addict staring at static I’ve waited patiently for something even slightly interesting to happen. If you watch for long enough your expectations of what’s entertaining are so lowered that it actually begins to seem like you’re enjoying yourself. But you’re not. I’ve been watching the dust motes dance in the shaft of light from upstairs all afternoon and it’s about time someone came home. Like any other junkie there was a moment in the past when I moved from getting a fix to feel different, to needing a fix to feel normal, an unfortunate moment which, like the point of falling asleep, we never actually notice. If something doesn’t happen soon I’ll go into withdrawal. And I don’t honestly know how much further I can.

        “Four o’ fucking clock! If it wasn’t for those Nazi Americans we could have had another hour in bed. I hate those bastards and their Axis of Evil.”

        “We probably shouldn’t be going to Florida then. And I bet you don’t tell them that when we’re going through customs.”

        If I’d been in the kitchen we’d have missed this. Sounds like the tubby bloke from Number Ten and his haggard young wife. I think she’s his cousin or something. Huffing and puffing their way down the stairs. He’s a heart attack waiting to happen I tell you. Lard three nights a week and gristle on top. Fat people get so much exercise you’d think they’d be fitter. He was a bus driver you know. Ran over a woman’s poodle and never got behind the wheel again. It can’t be a year since they were in Greece? His disability shouldn’t stretch to two trips and she’s never worked a day in her life that didn’t get paid for in Bensons. I wonder how they can afford it. The daughter got a doze on the beach from a waiter. Only thirteen and she dresses like a tart.
        “Take these down to the taxi for your old man. I have to go back and check the gas is off.”
        Lazy bam, no wonder he sweats like a pig. His boy’s hardly bigger than the case. He’ll do himself an injury trying to lift that.
        “What the fuck was that?”
        “The case fell.”
        “All the way down? Jesus Christ, be careful. They’ll get enough of that at the airport.”
        He pushed it the sly wee bastard.
        “I’ll help him Da.”
        “Don’t drop that one. It’s your mother’s and she’ll go mental.”
        Ah, enter Lolita. Look at the length of that skirt. If she bends over much further I’ll be able to see what she had for her breakfast.
        “You take that end. I’ll get this one.”
        “I’m going backwards, dinnae push us.”
        “I’m gonna pish on France when we fly over it.”

That’s not half as embarrassing as the time I mistook some pigeons for sexual congress.

Old man collecting comes round the doors, takes ages giving someone their stuff and thanks them for being so patient. Says they’ll come back to them again. Like the guy in the post office. Freak.

Condensed breath on the woodwork.

He’s probably a good catch. A bit boring, so the life you spend with him will seem much longer.

Harridan - scolding vicious woman.

He wasn’t near the front of the queue when the weapons were getting handed out.

I should say something but he looks so happy in that relief from desperation way. I suppose all this courtship’s a bit complicated these days. Not like in the twenties when we’d just get drunk and shag.

Most old people only go to the bingo for the passive smoking.

Stairwell of souls.

he CAMERA wobbles slightly, holding position looking down the hallway to the door at the far end.

Muffled voices and footsteps can be heard.

The CAMERA drifts down the hallway towards the door.

As it reaches the door the CAMERA moves towards the spy hole in the door and the view changes to a fisheye of the stair outside.

The Holiday Family descend carrying suitcases.

They are deathly pale and wear loud Hawaiian shirts and shorts.

Straw hats etc

Son: What happens to the pish if you go on the plane.

Father: It gets dropped on some lucky foreigners, son. (Fertilizer)

Daughter: I heard it turns to ice when it falls. (Frozen pish)

Mother (turning back): Did you turn off the heating, Billy? (Lock the door)  

Father (gesturing): Aye aye. Hurry up, the taxi’s waiting. (I’ve got some water skiing to look forward to.) Doesn’t look very athletic.

They descend out of sight.

Some dodgy geezers go up later and descend with electrical equipment, tv, lamp, etc and also a fish tank, with fish. One of them might ask another if that is his granny’s flat. He says, she’ll be at the bingy or something about her living quietly since his granddad died. (Could have a gigalo turn up at the flat later.)

The holiday family return, looking sunburnt and carrying loads of crap they bought on holiday.

Father has a broken arm, neck brace from a water skiing accident.

They disappear upstairs. Pregnant pause before. “They took ma fuckin fish.”
Postman descends looking ruffled. Tucking his shirt into his trousers.

Drunk Guy
Drunk guy staggers up stairs.

Fumbling at door. Keys dropped etc.

Door bangs closed.

A few moments later smoke alarm goes off.

Firemen arrive and charge up stairs brandishing axes.

Sound of door getting kicked in.

They descend carrying smoking chip pan leading drunk man who is talking.

Slurred, I just wanted some chips buddy.

I was gonna cook up some chips there.

The cooker must be broke buddy.

His face is blackened by soot.

Hang on a sec, there. He vomits just below door.

Later he will return with a bucket to clean it, cursing. Sound of scrubbing out of shot.


Like an astronomer staring out into the past

Temptress
A horny couple ascend the stair, stopping outside the door for a passionate kiss. The woman is against the wall and the man leans in but she spins him around and pins him, dominant. She moves away to continue climbing, reaching back with one hand to draw him on. He pauses for a moment then pushes off the wall with his shoulders, reaches out and takes her hand. They run off up the stairs to the sound of lusty laughter. Later she is seen descending the stairs dragging a large black bag which bumps wetly down each step. Later the police arrive and arrest her.

Drugs
Old lady slowly climbs the stairs and knocks at the door across the landing. Netty, yer late for the bingy are ye awlright. Loud knocking and peering through letter box. Eventually door opens and Netty appears, belt round arm carrying a syringe. Sorry, hen I was just cookin up. Hen and Netty enter. Later Netty’s friend emerges looking quite unsteady. A bit zonked.

People Phobic

Scary bag man descends stairs nervously. Door below opens. He freezes trapped in the headlights. Looks around paniced then scuttles back up stairs. Later he descends again. Could work it a couple of times. He does a not again, sigh, trudging resigned back up stairs. He could scuttle out right at the end if there is no supernatural ending. Post credits.

Alien
Lots of flashing lights from top of stairs. Alien descends. Later it returns carrying a dog. Ascends out of sight. We here barking and ray gun fire. Dog runs down stairs pursued by Alien who reaches landing and gives up chase. Returns up stairs. Lights again. Maybe dog should come down on its own. Have proper phaser blasts that move with the gun. 
End

At the end the police come to the old persons door. Someone has a big bunch of keys. The door opens and the camera pulls back to show the piles of mail. The police come in and go into the living room.

Sounds of conversation turn out to be television.

Glimpsed between them is the old persons body (step aside reveal). The spirit then leaves and goes down the stairs to the door, which opens to a blinding white light.

A child could lead the lonely person out of the door at the end into the light. Or they could just go into the light. Then go back to the flat and show them dead on the floor.
The child could be the old person as a child. How to show that.

Could change the bit with the bag man scuttling back upstairs to the person behind the door. But it may be better to only have them leave at the end when they are dead. Could have the pile of letters on the doormat.

The narrator could skip between all the different ages he has been. Or the spirit could represent all the various people who have lived in the flat over the years.


The body is watching a soap at the end, do you see what I’m saying.


Oh, there’s a dead old fella in my kitchen. I wonder how he got there. I should wait outside while these people deal with the situation. Nothing to see here, move along. I’ll just pop down stairs and be out of everyone’s way.
        They’ve left the front door open and it’s such a sunny day. I can hardly see it’s so bright. Usually I get a headache or I sneeze but I think I’ll be okay this time. A quick turn round the block will brighten me up. I’ve been stuck in that stuffy flat for so long, I feel like the mummy escaping the sarcophagus. It’s been such a long time since I was out and about. I wonder if the squirrels will remember me. I should have brought some nuts. And a hat. Never can be too careful with all these ozone holes in the thingy. Perhaps that’s not something I need to worry about, if I’m only going out for a little while.


In Stair, the bit about addicts, liken the transition from non-addict to addict to the transition experienced when falling asleep. You never really notice when it happens but since you are now sleeping it must have happened.
