# Old Haunts

Old Haunts
There is nothing like returning to the place of your birth to bring on a wave of unwelcome nostalgia, although the absence of family and friends crowding the platform makes my homecoming much easier to bear. No feigned interest, small talk or dog eared snaps of faded childhood memories. No awkward hugs or kisses. No firm hand shakes. Just a slow train emerging from a dark tunnel into a few seconds of bright sunlight before coming to rest in the murky half light beneath the smoked glass ceiling that hangs above the platform.

I step from the train into a cloud of diesel fumes and soot and remember the last time I was here, when I came to see the dirt fall on my father’s coffin. Surprisingly, given our past differences, it was not the happy occasion I had envisioned. For some unfortunate reason I felt no real satisfaction at his untimely demise. Although after a few beers I was able to fake it. In truth he had been nothing more than a grey shadow at the back of my mind for the last seventeen years, flickering occasionally into my consciousness in the moments when my resolve to be different from him was shaken. Like the old worn coat in your wardrobe that you never really liked the fact that he maintained a physical presence elsewhere in the world was of no concern to me. Ours was not a warm relationship. In fact we had never been closer than the length of a belt strap. But since I killed his wife I forgave him the occasional indiscretion.

I was told by my uncle at the funeral that he remembered my father being sad for a long time after my mother died. Of course I was too young to notice and had only one point of reference for parental behaviour anyway. But I do not think that he really missed her, he only said that he did. I think it was more that he resented me for realizing something that he had so often imagined and at such a young age too. He looked on it more as a missed opportunity or a stolen goal. He had been killing her slowly for years, chipping away at her life each day with cruel words and torments. Stealing the life she should have led for his mean spirited amusement. For me to arrive on the scene and deliver the coup de grace, however unintentionally, must have been quite a shock to his system. Like a show off finishing your jigsaw puzzle when you are out of the room. That is the emotion his brother mistook for bereavement.

Unfortunately for my father and I, the pregnancy, which may well have been part of his campaign of quiet abuse, did not end well for any of us. You see, my mother’s untimely demise had other, even more personal consequences.
I was born dead, pulled blue through a slit in her stomach as her final heartbeat echoed in my veins.

It was fortunate for me that my parents were in the middle of moving to a larger house, to accommodate the new arrival, which precluded the possibility of a home birth. So the doctors had at their disposal the finest medical equipment science had so far conceived. I was born into a brave new world of stainless steel and electro-magnetism.
They managed to revive me eventually but I was gone for a very long time. I did not particularly mind being dead, after all it was not so different from the life I knew, floating unconscious in blackness. And not just the blackness that is the absence of light, a palpable, enveloping blackness, like a blanket of dark cloth, pressing down from everywhere at once.

In the end I was a surprisingly healthy baby boy, normal in every way except for a suppressed breathing reflex, which I have learned to overcome and another slightly stranger affliction, a connection between this world and the next.
Yes it is true, there is an afterlife but it is nothing like the travel agents told you. No harps or clouds. No fire or brimstone. In fact it is not really a place at all. It is more like being in a very particular mood. But some people convince themselves that they are not going to like it, whatever it is and that is why they hang around. Loved ones, nearest and dearest, dawdling for a taste of the life they once knew, always needing just one more moment of sunlight and warmth. Desperate to maintain the pretence of their former lives however little they might have meant to them at the time.

Most of them are no trouble at all. Trundling through their daily routines, strangely oblivious to their change of state, until one day it dawns on them they have better things to do than watch television and pretend to mow the lawn. And they move on. But some of them become too insistent in their pursuit of the old days and begin to cause problems for the living. They have unfinished business or a wrong they must right or they grow to resent the world as it changes around them. Ghosts you might call them, or phantoms or spirits or shades.

And that is where I come in because I have this gift and it is not what you might think. Any fool can see dead people. Even though the living generally do their best to blank out any hint of their own mortality, you have probably seen one yourself and not even known it. Remember the old lady in the swimming pool following everyone around and chattering incessantly while being studiously ignored? She was dead. Remember the child playing in the swing park late one night as you made your way home? Dead. Seeing them is not the problem. Getting them to pay attention to what you are saying is. What makes me special is that when I speak, the dead listen.

If you want to get rid of an annoying spirit, perhaps it is affecting your property value or causing your children some sleepless nights, then what you really need is a good mediator. No crucifixes, holy water or religious mumbo-jumbo, just some good old fashioned conversation. I will have a little chat with the relevant entity, do a bit of research and then try and persuade them to sling their hook. Kind of like a counsellor helping someone move on from an unhealthy relationship.

Unfortunately it is not always as straightforward as it sounds. Dead people are usually somewhat preoccupied. If you want to know what its like to talk to them, find the stupidest person you have ever met and sit down next to them. Now imagine they are deceased. I don’t mean to imply that IQs drop sharply post mortem. It is just that most of the dead will not even acknowledge the fact they are, which can make finding their reasons for hanging around pretty tricky. And another thing, they do not always look the way you might think. Because they are essentially generating their appearance, you tend to find that they resemble their own self image more than their former physical manifestation. So even recognizing them can sometimes be a problem.
I climb the steep stairs out of the train station with some care. The steps are old and worn and there are too many hills in this city. However, I have been dragged back here by a particularly lucrative assignment, so I will put up with the ache in my calves. If that is the only hardship I have to endure before picking up my paycheque I will be fortunate indeed.

I let a busy bus pass by and hail a black cab that is following close behind it. Spirits hardly ever choose to lurk on methods of transport but there is no point in taking any chances. I want to be fresh for this evening’s encounter.

He thinks he’s visiting a client but it’s his dad pretending to be one.

That ghost had an unusual affinity with the physical. They almost always respect floors and have some regard for walls and doors, at least as they remember them. But I have never seen one use a kettle before.

It only dawns on me afterwards that he was the spirit.

It helps if you know who you are talking to. Old houses have many voices and it’s impolite to ask. (Self identity could be one of the first things to go instead.)

So we talk, and I listen, gathering hints and clues to identify the cause of the problem. (Sometimes I can just persuade them to move on.

After I leave the real work begins.

It’s impossible to mount a successful conversation without some solid facts.

There’s nothing more resistant to persuasion than a corpse.

I have to figure out why they are hanging around. What business have they left unfinished.

What is that one thing they should have done that keeps them here.

I need information to loosten their infatuation with person or place.

I help them on their way and remove the supernatural intrusion from my clients life.

I’m providing a double service, it’s just a pity I can only charge once.

The one place I know there are no answers are cemeteries.

Graves only have importance for the living.

They only serve to remind the dead of what they have become.

So that’s where I go when I need some peace.

A haven from the babel of lost souls. Dying every day. The ever increasing horde.

Soon even the least attuned will catch a word here and there.

Begging for one more minute of life.

(Something about the gay sex not being for procreation. All that energy expended. Pointless.)

It’s a surprise to hear my father’s voice. But he always was a patient bastard.

He has to get rid of his father. Ghosts don’t look like themselves, they look like their self image.

What if everyone is dead, the whole world is full of ghosts and it’s only when they realize they are dead that they die and move on.

The new ghost was his biological father or his real one. Information revealed to him as the ghost talks.
