# Runner Runner

Once, when I was much younger, I watched a sporting event on television. It was a middle distance race, neither too long nor too short, between the eight best runners (at this distance) in the world. If all the Earth’s population was stretched out across the longest starting line ever conceived, after I’m sure numerous false starts, these were the eight people who, after a few moments of the most cacophonous tramping in history, would be the first to cross the finish line. Whether Olympic Final or World Championship I cannot recall, but certainly a race of the utmost importance.
        
The confrontation went pretty much according to form, with the season’s most consistent athlete easing into the lead just past the halfway mark. Perhaps easing not being the most appropriate word to describe the titanic efforts being exerted by all the participants. The race was not over however, as one of the other runners, noted for his blistering finish, began, in the closing stages, to close the seemingly insurmountable gap.

Now the leader was travelling full steam ahead and was widely recognised at this time to be the fastest man on Earth (at this distance). All pumping arms and piston legs he was no longer demonstrating the same power and grace as in the earlier portion of the race but was by no means tying up. The second fastest man on Earth appeared to have left his surge too late when this happened.

The leader, presumably aware of his status as the fastest man on Earth (at this distance), instead of continuing his unbeatable dash towards the finish line, now only a few yards away, decided to look back. And there he saw gaining rapidly, but not rapidly enough to steal the lead, the second fastest man on Earth, and he was undone.

I could see, even from thousands of miles away, the effect. Muscles once operating in concert now became fundamentally opposed. Lungs with the capacity of an aircraft hanger choked to the size of a postage stamp and the pounding heart of an ox became the fluttering whir of a hummingbird.

So great was the detrimental effect of this backward glance that the former fastest man on Earth was required to console himself with a Bronze medal, second place having been snatched by the fifth fastest man, who had run out of his skin and not looked back once.

To what end the leader turned I shall never know. Not to belabour my point, but if you are widely regarded as the fastest man on Earth and are leading the most important of races (in the sense that it is the current one), in the very final portion of the endeavour, there should be nothing clouding your conviction to cross the finish line as soon as humanly possible. You shouldn’t be able to run any faster than you are running. You shouldn’t be able to be any further down the course than you are. So what can possibly be going on behind you that can be of the slightest interest at all?

If he turned round to gloat, then I wish he’d tripped and been last.
