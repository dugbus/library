# Ambition

When I was at school I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up but I was bright and did well enough. Then, just after starting high school, my Dad passed away. He had a heart attack one morning after getting up to go to work and died in hospital that afternoon. 

Whenever I remember that day I always see myself standing outside my parent's bedroom, not really knowing what was happening, trying to make out my father's shape on the bed through the rippled glass door.

I cried in class when I returned to school a few days later after telling the teacher I was sorry for not having a note.

The scores on my exams and tests gradually began to decline. Whether it was because I was approaching my academic limits or lacked motivation, it's hard to say.

I went to college for a year but found the course a poor fit, I was the only student who hadn't studied accounting, and being a commuter I missed out on most of the social side of secondary education.

After my Mum was diagnosed with cancer the first time, I tried to help, but the best I could usually manage was a nice cup of tea. Sometimes though, that was enough. I remember her coming to my room once to apologise for crying on the toilet in the middle of the night because the chemotherapy had made her constipated.

I wasn't there when she died but I visited her shortly before and even though she reacted to the sound of my voice for some reason I didn't hold her hand or touch her. If I could go back and change one thing it would be that.

I had my own health scare last year when it seemed for a few weeks that a mole on my leg was malignant and I had to reflect on the impact my own passing would have. I suppose it would be a lot less than that of the average forty year old. But you know, I'm okay with that. The doctor who told me I would be fine sat very close on the examination couch and I would have liked to have kissed her.

A few weeks ago I got home from having some drinks and there was a message on my computer saying that a friend I had only recently gotten back in touch with after several years was gone. It took me a while to realise the message wasn't about him travelling and I later found out he had been killed only a few hours before.

Everyone said he had done what he always wanted and that was true.
