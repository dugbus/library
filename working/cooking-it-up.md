# Cooking It Up

From bitter experience I have come to the conclusion that there are two very different approaches to cooking. My boyfriend’s, which is pretty cavalier when it comes to using the proper ingredients and just how much of them to chuck in the pot and mine, which involves digital scales, endless worry about the difference between red and green peppers and cooking times accurate to the second. That his concoctions always taste better than mine and are more, how can I put this, edible was a stumbling block in our relationship for quite some time. Eventually I accepted my role as dish washer and learned to put up with the carnage he would leave in his wake, while he now at least attempts to finish making the same dish he started.

The way in which my partner and I tend to deal with tasks like cooking or buying a car says a lot about our personalities and why I think we work well together. It seems clear to me, though he would probably disagree, that he takes the artistic or intuitive approach, while I am more scientific. I am always on time, which is unfortunate because he never is.

He’s the sort of person who’ll say let’s go to Paris on Tuesday, usually on Monday night. He also has a keen eye for unexpected presents. No bunches of flowers from the corner shop for him. If he stoops to something as mundane as flowers it will inevitably some strange and exotic orchid or a hundred year cactus that just happens to be in flower.

Now I know what you are thinking, I want to get myself one of those artistic types but it’s not all wine and roses. Remember those great off the wall gifts I was talking about before. Well, as exciting as they are you should be aware that it is extremely unlikely that they will put in an appearance on the day they are supposed to. Part of the reason he is so good at improvising and thinking on his feet is that important dates, birthdays for example, will tend to slip his mind and not just mine. He has forgotten his own so many times one would think he didn’t always enjoy them. No, there’s a lot to be said for the scientific approach too, and I’m not just saying that because that’s the way I deal with things. We are the yin to the artist’s yang.

Summary of Theory -

Is it better to be with a scientist or an artist? That depends on whether you are a scientist or an artist.

Not about intelligence, it’s about how people approach problems and situations.

Get away from calling them Artists and Scientists, too job like.

Are scientists better than artists at certain things, or vice versa? In general it’s more a difference in approach than quality, but they both have areas of superiority and it depends most on whether you are a scientist or an artist, which you’d want to be with. While a scientist would be a comfortable fit for another scientist they are going to miss out on some of the excitement and wild times that an artist would bring to the relationship. Similarly two artists are going to spend so much time being happy-go-lucky and avoiding near disasters that they won’t have the time to appreciate what they have. Scientists are reliable and need an artist in their lives. Artists are exciting and need a scientist.

Can a summation be made about what scientists and artists bring to a relationship?

Can an image be fashioned that describes it in a nutshell?

If a relationship is a road journey (and every road movie ever made is about just that) then a relationship with a scientist is like riding with a man with a map. Someone who’s been there before or looked up the route on the internet. You travel on wide safe roads and you get to where you wanted to go in the first place.
A road journey with an artist is different. You take the back roads where the view is spectacular. There are adventures, there are brief periods of being utterly lost and bamboozled. There is the chance that you might not get where you wanted to go. Then again you might just end up somewhere better.

If a relationship is a journey then being with a scientist is like a well planned vacation with a detailed itinerary and a map that shows exactly where you need to be. You will travel on wide safe roads and you won’t miss any of the sights in the guidebook on the way and there will always be somewhere to sleep at the end of the day.

Being with an artist means not necessarily ending up where you left for. You’ll find yourself on the back roads in the middle of nowhere in unexpected situations, most of which will be exciting and fun. But the rest of the time you’ll be lost and confused and for each of the strange new sights you come across on your wanderings one of the things you set out to see will have passed you by.

In The Kitchen - domestic stuff, cooking, shopping lists, spice rack organization

When you go shopping do you,

a. Make a list of everything you are going to get and stick with it.
b. Make a list of essentials and see what else takes your fancy.
c. Decide what you are going to buy after you get there.

Spice rack organisation,

a. Do you have a spice rack stocked with spices all from a single brand?
b. Do you have a spice rack stocked with spices from many different brands?
c. Do you have a random assortment of refills, bottles and boxes that you have accumulated over the years?

The problem with doing the quiz questions is that they take away something you can write about in the main body of the text. Maybe we should do the article first then see if there is enough extra material to support a quiz.

A few famous people, who typify one category or the other, possibly try to find couple who demonstrate the balanced approach. Or make some up.

Summary Advice

Don’t worry if you are a thinker and you’re with a thinker, or a feeler with a feeler as long as you are aware of the situation you can take steps to bring balance to your relationship by occasionally adopting the attitudes of the type you are missing.

Thinker and Thinker

If you are a thinker and are in a relationship with another thinker you may find that everything moves along just that little bit too smoothly. There’s no sex better than make-up sex and you won’t be having any of that if you never argue. If there’s never any rough water then you won’t be able to appreciate the moments of calm. If the biggest disagreement you can manage is who should be first in the bathroom in the mornings it may be time to deliberately throw a spanner in the works, just to breathe some life back into your relationship. One of you should take the initiative and arrange a surprise for the other person. Even planned spontaneity is better than no spontaneity at all.

Feeler and Feeler

Is there seemingly no structure to your existence? Do you flit madly from one near disaster to the next, always either on a monster high or perilously depressed? Exciting as life may be at times one of you needs to bring some order to the chaos. Try sitting down and planning something out for a change. It doesn’t have to be anything big at first, maybe just a weekend away. But you may find that sitting down and talking about what you are going to do is just as much fun as the trip itself. (Maybe too much about trips if we use the Road bit form earlier)

Thinker and Feeler

If you are the thinker in the relationship try to understand your partner’s wayward ways. It’s good that he or she (can you use they as a gender indeterminate term when it is not plural) has you around to provide some structure but you’d have a lot less fun if it wasn’t for them.
