# Tourista

Could sneak the bit about the poetry writing in here as well,

A woman its in a park writing a poem. A handsome man walks past and she incorporates him in her poem. Years later they meet.


There’s a guy up Calton Hill looking out over the city.

Two girl tourists approach and one takes the picture of the other, catching him in the shot.

He looks round a little sad looking but smiling when he sees the girls.

The girl with camera apologises.

He says its okay would they like him to take their picture, which he does.

The girl’s friend says it’s their last day on holiday and they have lots to do.

He asks if they have enjoyed their time in Scotland/Edinburgh.

He goes back to looking out over the Forth.

The girl with the camera keeps looking back intrigued as her friend hurries them away.

Transition.

(Radio announcer indicates that this is a foreign country. Aus or NZ)

The girl is showing the shots to her mother back home.

Her mother says it looks just the same as when she was student there.

“We went to the place you told us about.” Hands picture with man on it.

The mother starts a little when she sees the picture, confused reaction.

Daughter asks what’s wrong.

Camera goes out down hall past the girl’s suitcases with airport tags to door.

Sobbing OS.

Back on Calton Hill the man is standing again. 

“You took your time”

“I didn’t think you’d wait this long. (Beat) What did you think of your daughter?”

“Almost as beautiful as her mother.”

He puts his arm around her and they look out over the Forth, together.
