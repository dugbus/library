Probably not a particularly original thought but what if the orcs and elves of our stories are racial memories of the lost species of homo that we used to co-exist with? Orcs = neanderthals, erectus = elves, densiovans = ?

Rub the lamp

Meeting people is easy t shirt series
As a kid crossing the road it takes a couple of near misses to teach you a lesson. Hopefully that crossing the road is potentially life threatening and you should pay attention and not that cars always miss.

A murder club where they kill with a particular gun then pass it on to the next member to use so it seems like a serial killer.

Sadness and depression are surprisingly different. Sadness has a shape to its sensation. Depression is an absence. If sadness is the wake after a funeral, depression is the empty room after all the mourners have left. A whiff of sadness is present but the real difficulty is the absence.

FNOOR - Fundamental nature of our reality

I had a profound insight this morning. Half wrapped in sheets and sweating booze it occurred to me I wasn't making the most of my life.

You can take that attitude and stick a dick in it.

Entertainment was restricted when I was a youngster. We would shotgun Colt 45 cans and hold hands while someone applied a dry branch to the electrified cow fence.

Oh sweet prison of our first embrace.

We spend our lives observing reality reflected on the surface of the pond which is our minds. But the water of the pond is always moving and this movement distracts us from the realisation that we are experiencing the pond/mind. We never experience reality directly. It is always the brains reconstruction of our sensory input. If, through the practice of some technique, be it yoga, meditation or some other method, we can still the ripples on this pond then we will be able to see the pond clearly enough that we realise it is a pond and turn our gaze upwards to experience reality as it actually is.

Saturday is ever shorter. First there's eggs and then it's tea time. Very little in between to stretch the day. Front to back like a folded sheet and gone. Into the cupboard rarely to be recalled except to say. Where did the day go?

It used to be that round these parts, any fella with enough bullets and a big dick could make a name for himself.

Porn star name Christy Sheets.

Short film about wheelchair users who hate each other but always end up seated next to each other on their weekly trips to the cinema. Will I fuck go another day. That bastard can switch if he wants peace but I'll be buggered if I'll change for him.

The Clarity Act

astronaut/astronomer becomes obsessed with faint signal. attempts mental journey to distant planet. ends in empty bodied madness

A writer's biggest fan analyses all his work and discovers many repetitions. These lead the fan to believe that the phrases point to a message for the reader or a book the writer read in his childhood.

The Luncheon Companion
Someone has the job of meeting a rich and powerful person for lunch once every week and engaging them in an interesting and thought provoking conversation. The person has no idea what would happen if they failed to provide something suitable, but there have been insinuations that the last person to hold the position did not end well. Over the course of a few months the pressure begins to tell. Finally they crack up in a spectacular manner and it is revealed that that is always what happens.

Battle Forge Dominion

The Sleeping Cities
Need to get the notes from Dave.

Pickups
Don’t know what it’s about but it’s a good name for a story. It could be the film term rather than the more obvious dating meaning. Perhaps about the people who spend their careers filming inserts, hands picking up cups, etc…

Homunculus
The most natural/human person in a class full of students turns out to be a robot/teaching aid used by a group of androids/conservatives/aliens to learn how to fake humaneness but it is uncovered by the fact of it’s being the most human acting.
You are an android created by the Gov and released into the community as an experiment.
That’s kind of a cliché by now surely. The only thing more hackneyed would be if I woke up at the end of the story and it was all a dream.

When did you figure it out?
Figure what out?
That you are actually a fictitious character in a story still being written.
Is that why I feel a little unsubstantial.

I Accuse
A woman psychic’s unfounded accusations against a man as a serial killer actually drive him to become one.

Phantoms

It isn’t a threat, it’s a promise. It would be a threat if I wanted to make you do something, like sign the Kyoto Agreement or ratify the World Court’s mandate, but I don’t want you to do any of those things now. You are too late.
You had an opportunity to turn away from Path and you chose not to take it. And now you will die. One by one. Starting with the janitor of the Whitehouse and ending with you. You will have to watch everyone else involved in your corrupt administration perish. And then I will end you.
Astral projecting assassins and the specialists brought in to protect the government.

There’s no carrot. It’s all stick from here on out.

The checkout girl's jaw hung loosely without proper connection

I told her the eats, shoots and leaves joke and she laughed but when she told it to someone else the punchline had transformed into eats leaves and shits.

I recognise no moral authority superior to my own conscience. You behave in a civilised manner only through fear of the consequences. You are no better than a trained animal.

The slow down disease and its consequences.

A short story exploring the consequences of a world in which all an author’s/musician/artists works disappear/are destroyed when they die.

Using old people for methane production.

How come no-one who ever died tragically was a dick. It seems the best way to avoid having an accident is to be an asshole.

I’d rather remember than imagine.

Fate she always hands to me something that my eyes can’t see.

Post coital couple converse.
Are you religious? Why, because I was shouting Oh God? No it’s just that when I look at you I see the hand of the divine in your construction. Whereas I could clearly be the result of random mutations.

You don’t throw stones at a mad dog, or shout at it. You just let it bark.

Banging around in the kitchen as if one of the ingredients was still alive.

What is work but making money for someone who already has more than you will ever see.

As far as I am aware, which is about ten feet…

There is some primeval part of your brain that really, really freaks out when blood is oozing from your nut sack.

The guy who wanders the pubs of Edinburgh researching his guide book but he is broken now by the enormity of the task and wanders still.

I smell like perfume.

And that was when he told me in a voice like stinging snow, how the worth of my life would be calculated.

Nothing, nothing at all.

If I ever found myself in a place with more churches than pubs I would leave immediately.

A chess board with flat pieces that have lenticular whatsit on them that allows both players to see an image of the piece that is the right way up.

All the hobos that you see endlessly walking the streets are actually endlessly walking the streets. 

They are immortals. What are they up to?

You are born with parasites that make you do bad things like drink too much and whore around. When you’re young your body is strong enough to keep them in check. But when you are old (actually they may be why we age) they make you wet yourself.

When Y2K happened I saw the lights go out in Wellington.

I used to think that islands floated.

In the 1960s businessman John Martin built an impressive collection of first edition books.

Use your feather to travel to the Cliff of Leaves. There you will find a door. Unlock it with your feather, which you should leave in the door so that no one can lock it behind you. The passage beyond will lead to the shrine of Tulman Set.

Last year sucked. But I realise I’ve been saying that almost every year since I left school and the only common factor is me.

Window salesman psycho. You get cold called for some double glazing and make an appointment. A fellow turns up and talks about almost everything except double glazing. He spins off into some pretty way out conspiracy stuff, including alien abduction and teleportation technology. He thinks Star Trek is the governments way of preparing us to accept our alien masters. The phone rings and it’s the double glazing place apologising that their salesman couldn’t make it. Tense. Then the guy could break down and confess he is an abductee.
The double glazing salesman could be a persuader for a cult who persuades people to join and also to recommend him to their friends. Could also be like the man eating chicken carny trick where everyone is pissed when they find out it’s a man eating chicken but they brighten up when the carny suggests they could fool their friends by recommending a visit to the attraction.

Ted leans forward his forearm flat on the table. The sleeve of his jacket soaking up spilled beer. “I have discovered a mental state that makes time move forward very quickly.” He leans back, raising his eyebrows briefly, inviting further enquiry. I turn away and look towards Steve who is still trying to attract the barmaid’s attention. In my peripheral vision I see Ted’s eyes close and his head tilt forward his chin resting on his chest.

Time had slowed so much that I could see the snowflakes become powder bursts as the bullet ploughed through them.

Decoupling/uncoupling from the time stream.

Gains control of the time stream and becomes trapped/hides in a pre orgasmic moment.

Do you need someone to wake you back up? I can, at my leisure inspect the movement of every hair on your arm, individually. No one is more aware of what’s going on than I am. “Yes, but that’s details, details you could get lost in. What about the big picture.”
The trick is to relax your face.
That doesn’t sound so hard.
You have to relax it to such an extent that it feels like it’s going to drift away.
Or slide off?
Or slide off.
I think I know that feeling.

It was the kind of pub that had an upstairs and a downstairs. The downstairs was the place where the people who were too drunk to make it up the stairs went to drink.

How come you get to eat all that shite and look like a whippet? If I even walk past a chippy I go up another belt hole. You’ve been fat for years, why start worrying about it now.

Time had slowed so much that I could see the snowflakes become powder bursts as the bullet ploughed through them.

Banging around in the kitchen as if one of the ingredients was still alive.

Ice contains a memory of the past. As an iceberg melts and floats away it is forgetting what has gone before.

When you’re little and you run away from home, and you get 100 yards down the road, and you stop and cry and have no idea what to do. That’s my life, all the time.

Evil Crimes Unit

How many tobacco industry executives smoke? None of them and they still pretend it isn’t bad for you. Look at biscuit executives, sloping off with free boxes at every available opportunity.

There’s nothing so lonely as a single toothbrush.

A transport company that teleports objects by having the same object at the other end. Eg I send Duncan a copy of P Hamilton’s new book by posting my copy to their warehouse at this end and they send a copy from their warehouse at his end. It gets interesting if people can send things by posting a similar but not identical object at their end. Say I sent The Algebraist instead.

Spun gold and angels feathers.

Teleporting box, you climb in and swap places with someone, somewhere else in the world who has some random thing in common with you.

Love’s like chocolate. You can have all the different foods and drinks and tastes in the world, then one day you have your first piece of chocolate and it dawns on you that that is what it’s supposed to be like.

When I get home that night I discover I have been burgled, or more correctly ransacked. Most of the door is still there. I’ve always been a glass half full kind of a guy.

You are now going to explain to my why you borrowed one of the OB trucks and don’t give me any bullshit about it being enemy action. I know it was your cousin’s wedding. Well actually, it was my cousin’s wedding.

When is a story finished? When the deadline passes, when it’s published or does another story have to draw you away like the beautiful woman you meet in the bar, leading you astray.

Some stories are like marbles settling into the bottom of a bowl, this one is like a pencil standing on end. Every time I look at it, it falls over and I have to change something to make it stand up again.

He had stinge written through him like a stick of Blackpool rock. If Blackpool was called stinge.

I need a new girlfriend like I need a third testicle.

She prays to the god of small helpings.

Being dead is like being asleep for just one second.

These heroin addicts have entirely the wrong idea, always stealing stuff and getting banged up. You can have a pretty serious custard cream habit for only 99p a day.

Whale song is the whale’s version of blogging.

What are you going to do at the party? I’m going to get drunk and try to fuck someone and hopefully this time it will be a girl. I mean last time it wasn’t so bad. He was really funny. It’s not like I ended up humping some asshole. Well, actually I guess I did.

Life beat the smiles right out of me.

We must bring these dogs to heel.

I reached towards her eye and caught a tear on the tip of my finger, carefully transferring it to the tip of my tongue. That’s almost pure vodka you stupid, drunk bitch.

The whole no sex before marriage thing is ridiculous. I mean would you buy a chair you hadn’t sat in.

What if there was some root cause to entropy/aging that spread like an infection through the universe. Before it came into being everything was timeless. So that would be time or rather the flow of time then. Before everything was balanced and then one element tipped over and fell into the future causing a cascade.

Even if the future is predetermined you still have to make the decisions that cause it to happen.

What if I have no soul? What if I am an empty vessel that has confused itself into sentience?

The world ends when you are dead.

Excuses are the easiest things in the world to find.

Someone getting in a fight with a baby backpack on. The camera could do that chest mounted thing where it follows the baby as its father tussles.
Soft evolution, if you adapt to your environment and your environment is very forgiving you become weaker. Like glasses now, reducing the quality of the populations eyesight over time.

Losing your scruples is like losing your eyesight, slowly over the years it ebbs away in such small increments that you don’t notice. Until one day you are staring in the mirror and you can’t recognise the person looking back at you.

Not looking doesn’t make a problem go away. The leaky pipe under your floorboards still drips whether you can see it or not.

Your eye’s were glittering little sparkly pools of Stella, you’d had so much to drink. You were full.

A world where the islands are actually floating masses, drifting constantly on the seas. How would that affect the society?

People have an inbuilt obsession with filling up space. They see an empty shelf and the buy some books for it. They see an empty room and they buy furniture for it. The ultimate expression of this obsession is breeding like a bunch of crazed rabbits with no consideration for scarcity of resources at all.

You never get a second chance to make a first impression, unless you are talking to a goldfish or an Alzheimer’s sufferer.

Is that the kind of jacket you call a bolero? Why are you so interested in what I’m wearing? Well, I’m going to tell all my friends I met a beautiful woman and I don’t want to get any of the details wrong.

Why are you touching me? It’s important psychologically for me to reassure myself that other people are real now and again.

I wish I could conjure up a statement, either profound or affecting but all I have are platitudes.

The mind and body are two sides of the same coin. You can’t have one without the other. The mind needs the body to support it and without the mind a body is just an inert lump of flesh and bones.

Why do the synchronistic events I’ve been noticing recently happen? Like the flags in dog poop and the remote controlled skateboard. The how would probably be quite interesting as well.

An Eskimo and his friend are ice fishing; he gets a bite and starts reeling in. The whale he has caught bumps against the ice breaking off a big platform that the Eskimo and his friend are standing on. The friend leans over the side of the slab of ice and looks down at the whale. “Keep reeling, you’ve almost got him.”

I have always appreciated the conceit of making a fictional character anonymous. Eg and then M_____ turned to Steve and said…

Mr Jobby ringtone and animation.

As long as the kid is healthy and the right colour I’ll be happy.

Gems sparkle more before you polish them. As you work them they become less interesting. (Talking about overworking things)

Governments love apathy if the people don’t care they can get away with anything. That’s why I don’t mind Bono so much at least he is trying. In both senses.

There’s something interesting about empty rooms. I don’t know if it’s the absence of memories or their potential for the future. Maybe it’s just the Zen like austerity.

I’m an emotional infant, does that count?

One for the road, Mrs Swithensby?

I’ve been in the Green Room for about twenty minutes and I’m not really enjoying it.

How much of a fucker would that be?

If you are listening to the travel news I’m going to guess you are either intending to go somewhere or waiting for someone to come to you.

Do they call it nippy because the cold makes them stand up?

I’m apologising, the least you could do is acknowledge it. Well, being jostled in the pub by a clumsy person isn’t all that an unusual occurrence. If you’d spilled a drink on me or smashed me on the side of the head with an ashtray, it would be a different story.

It was one of the gay guys in the corner who had been cackling all night about everyone else’s footwear.

Therapist = The rapist

We need to find a toilet soon, I’m touching cloth here.

Earthquake blanket.

People’s interactions influenced by the way people interact on television/movies. Films are not getting more realistic, reality is getting more like films.

And that’s when I heard my bedroom door creak open.
The last time I had an experience that was anywhere near as unpleasant was back in school. I was in metal work class. I was unengaged with the ongoing lesson. So I decided to see what drawing a big metal rasp across the bottom of my front teeth felt like.

We were out there with no ammo, our asses hanging in the wind.

Even our British buddies couldn't help us because the manufacturer of our SM-61s had built in a 'safety feature'. Push a UK magazine into the breach and it would drop straight back out.

The weapon rejected any unauthorised attempts of bullet usage. Meant they could vary their prices across markets. And not worry about any grey area sales.

The distant sounds of traffic remind me of the waves on the beach that I have travelled so far from. The little lapping cars, and every now and then a lorry breaks upon the pebbles.

And what about the Neo Christians.

They call their promised land Gracie.

Do you think they'll last longer than the other lot?

I don't know, taking all the principles but rejecting the historical inaccuracies, pretty smart way to go.

The barman asked if we were paying together, which I thought was quite a strange question. Isn't that how rounds usually work? His collar was turned up, rugger bugger fashion and after we sat down I noticed that he was playing with a miniature ball. Repeatedly throwing and catching passes with a simple childlike amusement. Probably taken one hard tackle too many.

A shopping centre that subtly reconfigures itself to make sure you get to the exit you want.

Before any self censorship can kick in I have raised the scissors, still closed, and inserted them experimentally into my ear.

Why do Americans call Lego, legos and Speedos a speedo.
If I can’t find any other way to be famous then I plan on spontaneously combusting, preferably somewhere public, in view of some CCTV cameras.

You don’t drink in West Lothian for any length of time without having at least one occasion when you end up pissing out your arse.

I think we have to consider it a failure overall, I mean subsistence farming can hardly be considered a success.

I’ve been looking after my nephew this week so I’ve had to find substitutes for my usual barrage of cusswords.
The nephew could later comment on the strange language.
Jumping around like a high voltage epileptic.
Cupped hands in the desert will always become empty unless you fill them with sand.
Strunk and White, The Elements of Style. I had a similar reaction when I got mine on my Birthday last year, I looked at the cover, then glanced down at what I was wearing, and was in the middle of framing a withering remark, involving the fashion police and my friends sometimes wayward dress sense when she worked out what was going through my head and said, "It's not about clothes." In that special way that women who don't really like children have of addressing children and stupid men.

Lonely sock syndrome. Everyone else is in pairs.
Tales from the charity Box
It’s like in the late 70s in Russia, when the KGB introduced the traceable boot. The winter boot introduced that year, and issued to the whole population had an identifying watermark imbedded inn the sole so that each footprint the wearer left was identifiably theirs. For economic reasons we don’t need to explore, only the left boot was watermarked so there was a lot of hopping going on in clandestine circles. Suspicions were raised when the boot was initially unveiled as it was much more stylish than usual.
If you don’t have anything you can’t lose it.
I think you wake up every morning a slightly different person, but the change is so slight, like slowly losing your eyesight, that you don’t really notice it. You think you’re the same but how could you be?
Some people are nomads and some people are sedents. Some people produce and some people consume.
I’d seen the old lady before, using her oblivious to traffic road crossing technique. Several wind wrapped plastic bags stuck to her walker, her glasses slightly askew, one lens missing.
If your room smells, burn some toast. Then people will come in and say hey you burnt the toast. Rather than, this place stinks.
If you were the only evidence I would lean more towards creation than evolution.
Film begins on a travelogue type shot of a leafy glade next to a stream. Could be the Amazon. Dappled light shines through the leaves. A little wallaby hops into view. Drinks from a pond. Cute. Starts hopping up the gorge. Music gets threatening. Rustles in the bushes. Has a narrow escape. Camera leaves gorge revealing Highlands. Pan up to sky. Plane flies across. Cut to Edinburgh airport. Arriving scientists discuss incongruous animal sightings. Here to study ghosts that turn out to be zombies.

A thousand years of painful wailing. For a breath of air in a smoke filled room. All my hopes are fallen leaves. Trampled to mud by uncaring feet.
So you have spread your seed? Admittedly not far, but in various directions.
So where’s your girlfriend. She’s not coming, she’s doesn’t like white people. Why. She’s a Darkie. It’s like a militant form of being Coloured. Like some gay people refer to themselves as Queers. What’s she doing with you? She says it’s an affliction/affectation.
Economising down to two meals a day, was pretty much as far as I was prepared to go.
I was standing on Calton Hill, which is in the middle of Edinburgh for those of you who don’t know it. It’s only a little hill but it’s bigger than the buildings around it. There’s an old observatory on the top where I once took some astronomy classes.
I’ve heard people say it must be easier to get over bereavement when the death came at the end of a long illness, but I’m not so sure. We had a long time to dwell on the impending demise of my mother. If I’d come home one day and her healthy life had been ended suddenly I think the surprise would have been easier to come to terms with.

The warm bread story. How I met my wife.
The truth is a concept we had to invent because we came up with lying. You could say that animals lie, but disguising yourself as a stick or an owl is more akin to subterfuge than actual dishonesty.
Who is she? She works in the supermarket and I have this ridiculous crush on her. It’s like being fourteen again. If she smiles at me or says hello I float home like a dizzy schoolgirl. If she’s busy or blanks me, it’s like my fucking dog died.
No. she’s my solicitor. Actually I just like saying that because it makes me feel like a grownup.
That’s a big fucking pigeon.
That is a seagull.
It must win all the races, it hardly seems fair.
Do I always want to be alone or would I like to share my life with someone hot.
Did you ask her?
Yup.
What did she say?
She laughed.
Man, I’m sorry.
No, it’s okay, she has a great laugh.
Given the astonishing fullness of time, all things must come to pass.
UnBummed, the game show.
Time passes, things change.
That’s quite an unusual surname. Not in my family.
As though the faces of people in the street are bright lights.
He makes my teeth itch.
All of your pseudo intellectual yammering means nothing. You can bring up all the special cases and dubious exceptions you like. And what I’m saying will still be true. Like if I say grass is green, you can say, oh but it’s yellow in summer or it’s blue in Kentucky, blah blah blah. Grass is green. Fuck you.
Like soft shoes on quiet stairs.
Like the time Sue told the guy who was trying to pick her up that he would have to ask her Dad. So he heads round to see the old man who goes mental and beats the shit out of him. Of course it wasn’t her house at all. His daughter was 14.
Look at yourself in the past as an ancestor. You have inherited your current situation like the dusty dresser in the attic.
Actually there is something I’ve been meaning to ask you.
Finally, you’ve no idea how long I’ve been waiting for you to say something, anything.
Well, I didn’t think I’d been so obvious but now it’s out in the open, do you think your sister would like to go out for a drink with me?
My sister? I’ve been waiting all this time to tell you I have absolutely no interest in you so that we can both get on with our lives and it turns out you want my sister. Mother fucker.
Contrary to popular romantic notions there isn’t someone for everyone. What there is, is someone who’ll do. For now.
Someone gets stabbed in the cheek and bites down to try and stop the blade from being pulled out. Teeth grind and break as it gets dragged back out.
No. its because everyone who works here is a fucking bed wetter.
All I need is an attractive woman to put my pee-pee in.
Encapsulte her life, the waitress over there.
Taken roughly, from behind.
What about him, the guy in the suit.
Held the ring but never wore it.
Not even a guilty murmur.
Criminals use the shooting of a movie bank robbery to stage a real heist.
I wrote her name on a piece of paper that I clung to for months. Then one day it was gone. Now and then in the deepest part of the night I’ll turn over in my sleep and see the paper again, and read her name, and repeat it like a mantra that I try to carry until morning but it always melts away.
And then every nerve ending in your leg explodes in a big fiery cataclysm.
You and I look up the word expensive in very different dictionaries.
Illustrating is more difficult than photography because you have to make it interesting and acceptable. If something looks a bit off in a photograph people except it because it is real. Like a documentary where you can show the most bizarre events that would never stand up in a work of fiction.
Have you ever looked at your watch and it’s taken the second hand a moment to realise it should be moving?
I find the prospect of impending embarrassment is always much worse than the actual embarrassment itself.

Two characters at dinner are waiting for a third. They are talking about anything to avoid having to discuss the person they are going to meet. One starts telling a story about Aunt Mary, the person arrives and interrupts the story. But there will be another book of short stories or writing fragments that connect to the main novel but are not necessary for its enjoyment. The story of Mary would be one of the tales in this collection, a companion piece.
Parable of the runner. One char tells another the story. When the runner gets to the end of the race and can see the finish line, the important point is that he knows how far he has to go. It’s not going to change. So there is no reason to hold back he can give his all. But life isn’t like that, you have to pace yourself because you don’t know how far away the finish line is or what obstacles might suddenly appear in your path. Could be using the idea as an excuse for underperforming.
Get mail at wrong address. Chuck in bucket. Follow short chain of events to conclusion. Mail was invite to bingo or something more convoluted, if the person had gone they would have won the weekly accumulator. Or met someone. No way to know causal result. Decreed by Fate until I intervened.
Do you get ugly pigeons? I know that to me one might look a bit off. That’s a bit of a rum bird. But will the other pigeons feel the same. Like Cruft’s, dog shows in general. Do the dogs have the same criteria as the judges. Probably not. Could liken it to racial judgement. All Asians looking alike to Westeners etc. Big tail aesthetic. Monkeys with big butts.
Its not the next day that you suffer. Your body’s still in shock. It’s the day after that when it realises how much you brutalised it that it exacts its revenge.
Exercise is a fundamentally bad thing.
I was walking along the street and saw a little boy standing at the open door of his house and he looked like he was contemplating taking the big step down. He was very little. So I pointed at him trying to indicate that it was probably not a very good idea. But my gesture distracted him at the crucial moment and he looked up to see what I was going on about without arresting his forward motion. And he fell. Doubly unfortunately his gran was looking out the window and saw my gesture. This would probably have been alright if I hadn’t suddenly lowered my arm while looking incredibly guilty and aghast. Then the kid started crying and she made one of those cause and effect connections that resulted in it somehow being my fault he had fallen. I tried to suggest that I was pointing because he had fallen but she was having none of it and accused me of being a witch. I didn’t think she looked that old. But apparently in some parts of Leith it’s still a problem. One toddle too far. Incongruous reaction.
Discussing US TV prudery, my friend has a skin graft on his leg which came from his arse. That means that every time he wears shorts he is actually showing off part of his arse. Would that be a problem. Or make up something more extreme. It is only skin. Difference between male and female nipples.
Her standing by you was a major plus. But if you end up back with her only because of gratitude you will be doing both of you a disservice.
Children and teens are light, middle aged people have accumulated more experiences and are therefore more weighty and dense, so harder to move. There comes a point in a person’s life when their ability to hold on to their experiences starts to wear down ie they start to forget and they begin to lose mass and become frail. Critical mass of experience.
Peer support was originally the reason we developed a society. But this facility has become overburdened as population densities have increased. I don’t know who my neighbours are. So communities have become non-geographical. CHUD for example, football team supporters. Or Barony Street survivors. Bump and stick. Nebulous. Connections.
I like it when things go just badly enough that you get the message without suffering any injuries.
She has the worst taste in men of anybody I have ever met. If you sent her to the Pastry Shop she would come back with a shit cake. Or battenburg.
I will die with hands untied.
The important thing is to have high standards to start off with, then you can revise them down when required. If you start off with your sights set low (low standards). Have low standards to begin with it’s very hard to raise them at a moments notice if there is a sudden requirement for higher standards. Difference in difficulty between dropping and lifting.
Whatever way you look at, and I have tried a lot of different angles, nine years is a long time to spend doing nothing.
I hope you are not over-priming their expectations.
Perhaps your TV was overburdened by the weight of expectations and chose to avoid critical examination by pretending to be broken. Performance anxiety was the phrase I was frantically grasping for. And it’s not often you can say that.
Connoisseur. Connoisewer.
Contra-thought.
It’s only a car crash. I don’t know why everyone’s finding it so interesting that they have to slow down. Maybe they’re not slowing down to look. Maybe they are slowing down because they have just had a graphic reminder of the dangers of driving too fast.
That’s like saying shit tastes better after you’ve cooked it.
It was real decadence. I didn’t clean my teeth or anything.
I have an example of the fallacious way your brain makes connections. Every time I see the people in the flat next door they are in their kitchen. This is because it is the only window of theirs I can see. When I mentioned them to my friend and came to describe them I said they were always cooking. Because the only time I see them they are in the kitchen. I have made a mental assumption that they cook all the time. Well do they? Yes.
The old man putting bread out for the pigeons on his window sill so that he can catch and eat them.
She would snap like a little twig, if I gave her all my love.
Doing a little seemingly insignificant act often enough can lead to unexpectedly catastrophic consequences. I used to lie on the couch and pick my nose and flick it under the radiator under the window in the lounge. After about two years of this my mother decided to get a new carpet and being the kind of woman she was that meant thoroughly cleaning the one destined for removal. The first thing she said was, “Have you been eating grapes?” The second thing she said was, “I think we have a rodent problem.”
There are two methods of instruction. Point out where someone is going wrong and make them feel bad about it or show them how to improve and do things better. One way makes them feel like an idiot. The other doesn’t.
There’s always next week. Until there isn’t. (There’s always tomorrow until one day there isn’t.
Repetitively telling a curious child that the thing is not of interest.
Lots of people in sleeping bags laid out like the body bags after a disaster. Like a record attempt sleep out.
Enlarge a hole in the ground to uncover a river running far below. Enormous buttresses supporting the ground.
Pelvic thrust exercise machine.
Eating uncooked broccoli.
A room full of woman in pairs, one young and one old, getting their nails done.
A dead woman turned to alabaster, but with a sheen like sweat.
We run our hands over the tray of seeds to align them correctly. Then fit a board on top, which proves to be difficult.
John was always a short fuse kind of guy. Sometimes you would say or do something to light the fuse and he would explode in violent rage. Other times he would explode in violent laughter. Either way he always exploded. But there was a characteristic pause, a quiet moment, just before he went off where I would have lived my life if I could.
Why should I jump in and attempt to disrupt a flow of such caustic beauty.
Everyone else was working the next day. You were the only one to chicken out. No everyone else was at work the next day. Being there and working, that is not the same thing.
I’m visiting a bar that is always quiet, because it’s early.
We found a mirror that lead to another world where we also lived but were monsters.
I dreamt about a house on Findlay Street. Find. Lay. I wonder what that could mean.
…but Suze thinks otherwise and follows him.
A guard who gets depressed and leaves his post in search of something more fulfilling. Goes on a quest and ends up guarding somethings else. Or the same thing in a different form.
He is obtuse.
Women, if you can’t fuck them, fuck them.
You will be the Jackal’s breakfast.
Field of peasants women working. They are carrying baskets. Reveal the baskets are full of bullets. Which they are planting.
Turbo quiz, contestants get 10 seconds to answer multiple choice questions. The quicker they answer the more points they get but the more points they lose if they are wrong.
A sequence of ideas tailored to provoke a particular release of information from a carrier. A mnemetic password.
Conciousness transfer is the important part. Cloning exactly the same body isn’t. As long as you have a nice car…
Ocular feedback. When you dream, sympathetic images travel back up the optic nerve and display faintly on the retina.
Walking along the street I saw a pretty pissed off guy slamming his fist against a door. I tried to sidle past unobtrusively. As I past I glanced back and noticed clutched behind him a bunch of beautiful flowers.
I was waiting to cross the road and when a bus passed. Everyone inside had their heads down or were otherwise turned away. Except one girl who looked out straight at me, which was strange because I used to work with her.
The Twilight Zone is an area for illicit purchases.
In the back seat of a car with my head on the parcel shelf I stare up through the back window at the fake sky above.
I banged on the doors of all the apartments to worn of the impending disaster and everyone who came out was Mexican.
Reciprocation coupons represent the work you have done in the service of the community and can be exchanged for the services of others. We have gotten away from this possible definition of money, which has become a thing in and of itself. How can you charge interest on work?
A word for thought made flesh.
She won’t be hanging about watching over me. Her soul, spirit, whatever will be off somewhere else, continuing her journey. I had a vision once of the life after death. There was a glass wall with a trillion heads behind it screaming silently to be let back in. Must have been double glased.
I have issues of nearness.
The bigger the wings you need to fly, the further the distance between you and the next plane. Do you see what I am saying?
It’s more of a resemblance than an impersonation.
The eyes are projectors, not receivers. We walk around like cars at night with our headlights glaring and where our gaze coincides with someone else’s the illumination becomes all the more bright. When you go to sleep the world slowly fades like an afterimage on the retina. Each person projects a slightly different world and they have to average out to form a consensus reality. When you blink the universe has a chance to rearrange itself. People wit stronger wills could exert a greater influence on the consensus.
It takes seven throws to make a rider because you have six shots in your gun.
I believe that everyone is born with one good idea and the mark of a life fulfilled is to identify and propagate that one idea.
I feel that you should devote your life to telling wonderful lies as this is obviously your true calling.
We would be a forward thinking, easy going species, if it wasn’t for 90% of the population.
Nothing happens in a second that doesn’t also happen in an hour.
The rain lashed down in torrents. I have never been so cold. The hunger gnawed, a trapped rat in my stomach. A roll of thunder drowned the wet hiss of rain on tarmac.
If I had what you might loosely describe as a personal philosophy it would be, thou shalt not judge or deal in absolutes. Album X is not the best album ever. But it could be the album that you enjoy listening to the most. Roger is not a scientist. Roger’s occupation involves scientific enquiry. Two people share a slice of cake. One enjoys it and says the cake is good. The other doesn’t like it and says the cake is bad. Obviously the cake hasn’t changed so there must be something wrong with the statements they have made.
If you lost an arm he’d be the first person round to offer the loan of a watch.
It was the book, “I Remember” by me.
I was immobilised by mirth.
He’s such a chuff monkey.
I’d like to sully her countenance with a splash of manly fluid.
When you’re running a race and you’re second you can either spend your time hoping the leader falls or you can concentrate on running faster. I am an advocate of the second technique.
He went down like a two dollar hooker.
And all she had on was a Freudian slip.
Is it true that there is breed of moth that lives on tears?
It’s getting better in the same way a shite on the carpet gets better as it dries.
The heckler at a comedy show who becomes a target for religious extremists or a cult figure. (Spouts some words of wisdom)
A man goes to the doctor and after several tests is diagnosed as “being asleep”.
The kindly pensioner who feeds pigeons in order to trap and eat them.
The pervert who lies naked in bed as a trapped bird flies frantically round occasionally shitting on him.
It was interesting because it was about a person. If it had been about a situation or an abstraction it would not have been so engaging. It wasn’t about a cop. It was about a man who happened to be a cop.
I would love to do that but it would involve me spending the next two to three years of my life in court trying to dodge the corporate shitstorm that would descend from the panelled boardrooms on high.
98% of all discussions, in the entire history of the human race have involved two people with entrenched opinions meeting to discuss how best to avoid changing them.
I’ve been feeling a bit more frisky of late, which probably means having to drag my saggy arse out on the campaign trail one more time.
A simple story, well told.
Of course I don’t think about it. If I did I would be awake all night, anger pounding in my temples and in the morning I would find myself in the attic liberating my gun from the freezer bag that’s kept it dry in the cold water tank all these years.
The problem is they are too stupid and short-sighted to conceive of anything better. They are ignorant and unimaginative and that’s the way they govern. When we finally get up the nerve to kick in their doors and blow their underused brains against the wall they’ll still be grubbing around in the mud looking for their trinkets.
Feet on the ground. Head in the clouds.
You can look to the base earth to see where you are walking or you can turn your gaze to the skies and be lead by the stars.
The Unconc Club personal service where the members are rendered unconscious and then get to fantasise about all the things that happened to them while they were unconscious.
Memebers of the fictional band Sicknurse.
The closest I got to my father was at the fat end of his belt.
There’s no more arguments now. Worms ate his tongue long ago.
I didn’t mean we should burn them like set them on fire. I meant burn them like bad cards in poker.
Behind the setting sun paints its red on everyone.
Our choice is not between war and peace. It is between living with dignity and without.
Our choice is not between War and Peace. It is between Freedom and Tyranny.
Resist.
We are no longer the dominant species on this planet. We have been out evolved by the corporate parasites that are bleeding it dry. A properly functioning society should maintain a healthy well educated populace. They should be able to read and count, have somewhere to live, and food, and access to entertainment and understand how the events of the past have lead us to the current situation. The most important thing for a child to learn is the desire for education.
Let’s face it most science fiction is some geek trying to imagine a universe where they could get laid with some regularity.
If you are a shit shoveller and you turn up at work. And they tell you to shovel shit, it shouldn’t be a big surprise.
But why does the giant robot open his heart shield before combat. How else could he fight?
If I wanted to pay £5.60 to listen to a child squealing for two hours I would have gone to Thailand.
There is a world where people are so bored they buy cures to have diseases. They go to the shop and buy aspirin to experience a headache. One guy has been saving for years to get a CAT scan, but he’s not sure what he’ll get because it’s so experimental. A CAT scan’s not a cure though, it’s a diagnostic tool. Whatever. What about all the diseases for which there is no known cure? Does nobody get them?
I remember reading a few years ago about a child born in Wiltshire of all places, who had a blood imbalance that rendered him the equivalent of tipsy. Ironically the only way to address the imbalance was for him to drink alcohol. He ended up the world’s only sober alcoholic.
Never try to overthrow the government on an empty stomach, was one of the few pices of advice from my father that I had consistently heeded over the years. So I headed down to the little diner on the corner, near the Chinese Laundry. Very different to the greasy spoons back home. That would be a fine name for a franchise. The food seemed like it was more healthy. Less grey and beaten down. But the underlying tang of heavy chemical addition still left a bleachy film on my teeth. Aesthetically though, the golden pile of scrambled eggs and flesh pink bacon were a triumph. Almost living up to the well composed photography of the menu.
A lot of times I seem to remember the future. Not in any great detail except for the moment the image is formed. You don’t know anything about the future of the image. Just the image itself.
What about throwing your wake before you die, so that you can participate in a manner that is more active than is usual?
Hey, my names Din Luxley. By any chance, was your father a science fiction writer?
I don’t know, about as many times as Ghandi had chickpeas.
You know you could make any piece of shit and someone somewhere would love it. (Fractured market) Some people love anything as long as it is loved by as few other people as possible. But that’s not a pure kind of love.
Some people like to be quiet and concentrate but I like to talk shit while I’m working. It keeps my higher thought processes busy allowing my lizard brain to take over.
I just seem to be living the same day over and over again. So I’ve started to write in order to differentiate them. Monday was the day I wrote about the duck. Tuesday I turned to religious matters. It’s not much of a distinction I admit but it’s better than nothing.
In a conspiracy of hope we all face the future.
A teardrop of molten glass falls from an icicle shard of the shattered window.
I turned stick slow in a stream and felt civilisations last gasp lover’s breath hot on my cheek. The gentle pull of inhalation, then a wall of air seeking escape.
Look son, a fire engine painted red. Lights flashing. Sirens. He didn’t even turn his head. “That means somebody’s house is on fire.”
Randy Pitchfork and his nicotine stained hair, the ends dipped in tea.
How can you say what you are saying with a serious face?

I find it very difficult to argue when you have adopted a position of such indefensible stupidity.
Like a spider with broken legs spending the rest of your short life in the dust bag of a vacuum cleaner.
A small studios star dreamer is having trouble with their latest production. Only small sections of a dream are useable each night but the quality of the visuals are exceptional. To make the stories coherent the actors perform their scenes only for the dreamer who tries to carry the memories of the performance into their sleep.
A nocturne is a painting of a night scene.
They put shell hardener in chicken feed you know.
The doomed character who knows they are doomed but goes along anyway with their inevitable fate. Perhaps they rebel right at the end. Not going quietly at all.
The story is the journey of the character towards recognition of their situation.
I get up when I wake up. My body should know how much sleep it needs. My alarm clock doesn’t.
You know how it is. You see something you really want and it is the most important thing in the world. And you get it and you cherish it. Then a week later it’s only exciting when you’re showing it off to someone else. And the week after that, you only notice it when you trip over it. Well, it’s not like that with you. It’s been three years now and I’m still as happy as a kid on Christmas morning.
Yeah, that’s great. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something.
Knotted stomach.
I’m only little. I’m in me pants.
All things must pass.
She was a spirited alcoholic.
The magic tattoo idea.
Love is staying together until the last possible moment.
My eyes swelled (bulged) in desperation.
I wear loose shorts and tight pants in order to preclude emergent behaviour.
If you have a teleporting frog you need two cages. Do you see?
I wouldn’t let him lick the sweat off my shit.
Is there no beginning to the excitement?
I don’t want to turn round and find my nose in the crack of someone’s arse.
Skinny guy passes, speed walking. Closely pursued by a gentle sobbing chubby girl, but Gordon I really need a burger.
I was out like a log.
I was indeed a flushee, it happened to pretty much all the boys during their first week at the academy. Most folks wisely got it over with. Others foolishly dodged the flushers for as long as they could, making their final baptism all the more severe. Only one guy got done with a shit in the pan, although quite a few had some pee.
And which madhouse did you spring from. The one you’re still in.
Do you particularly enjoy films featuring migrant workers?
Rise up like a horde in the tide of the night.
He has more money than you could imagine. I don’t know about that I’m quite creative. You say he has an apartment in Monaco and a super model girlfriend. That’s peanuts. I’m thinking more, moon base and genetically modified women.
I don’t like other people very much and unfortunately that includes women.
I don’t like other people very much, which makes forming relationships difficult.
People are always asking me directions. I must look like someone who knows where they’re going. But I never can tell them. Maybe I should get out more.
And it was all a dream, but what if instead of that being the end it was the beginning and even though the things in the dream never really happened, as the story continues that seem to have an effect on the characters or otherwise intrude on the story.
And a new revenue stream springs into being.
Some people give off an aura of knowing where they are going. If it’s weak they may just often get asked for directions. But if it’s strong and they nurture it they could end up as religious or cult leaders.
I stopped seeing the friends I had made who had strong religious views, not because they annoyed me but because I was afraid I would persuade them of the fallacy of their beliefs. Imagine how bad I would feel if a true believer was excluded from eternal paradise because of something I said. If someone dies and they believe and it’s not true, it doesn’t matter. They might experience some spiritual form of embarrassment but nothing too serious. But if they die, not believing even after a lifetime of gullibility then they’d still be in trouble. (probably best as an explanation to a friend who doesn’t understand why she has been excluded from his life)
Isn’t it strange that regression therapists, if that’s the right term, always find that the patient suffered in the past from their specialist subject? I’ve never heard of someone having a troubled life, visiting a Satanic Abuse specialist to get regressed and finding out they were actually abducted by aliens.
They are talking about a mutual friend who thinks she was abused. Her father was terminally ill and she flies over to be reconciled and he confesses his sins to her. But the thing is he never did anything. She’s deluded, but he cares for her so much he is willing to confess to something he didn’t do to try and help her after he is gone.
She says the thing she will always regret is that she didn’t touch him, hold his hand. She pretended to herself that she would see him again but she knew it wasn’t true. She just couldn’t reach out across that foot long gap of years and life to make contact with her past.
They are in bed. She’s on top. He’s kind of half holding her up and he says, “How lucky am I?” She says, I don’t know. He spreads his arms wide, letting her go so that she drops onto his chest and he says, this lucky.
I looked across the bar towards what I had mentally christened the Slightly Older Ladies table. They looked to be having a particularly good time. Lots of laughing and giggling. Then I noticed that one of them was surreptitiously throwing up in the ice bucket their wine bottle had once occupied. Little comedy burps of vomit splashing in the water.
Evidently someone had pressed the wrong button because when the doors opened there was no party. Only the back of a plasterboard wall and some wooden batons barring entrance to a floor under construction. “At last the truth is revelead. Life is a façade and we have been granted a glimpse behind the curtain. Laughter. The elevator starts moving again and from somewhere to my right a voice. You all seemed to take that surprisingly well. I thought we were all fucked. (Better line) So what was it that made you so anxious, the glimpse behind life’s façade or being trapped in a lift by plasterboard?
Truth = Exact accordance with that which is.
Girl says, you should look in the mirror more often. Then you wouldn’t forget what you look like. If you don’t know how you look. How can you know yourself? Yes, but most of the time women spend looking in the mirror is time they are spending trying to make themselves look like someone else. How fucked up is that?
You have to have experiences in order to have something to write about. If you don’t do anything what are you going to write? My name is Bob. Bob sits in his room. Bob likes his room. Yeah, but Bob’s book sold 3.2 million copies.
What about that girl over there? Well, she’s very attractive but she’s no Goldie. No-one will ever be Goldie, she was an idealized vision. In fact Goldie wasn’t even Goldie. Her name was Susan. I called her Goldie because you could see the vitality glowing out from deep within her. I would never have defiled her perfection by actually touching her. It would have been like licking a Rembrandt. You never touched her because she wouldn’t let you.
I thought this was a dinner party. I like to suppress my appetite by eating food.
I never got married because I never met anyone I liked who liked me at the same time.
Chuck wagon race, like the land rush. A woman’s skin streams back and gets caught in the wheel. Slowly stripping off her body. She gets older as her skin is pulled off.
You are lying in bed at night and you look across to the door, which is very slightly ajar, the light from the hallway edging round it. Consider that as a perception of the whole universe.
I’d kiss her downy arse.
Like a long war the rational has been lost to time.
There are some real nutbags out there but psychological states are a continuum. There are no discreet steps to nuttiness. Everyone is somewhere along a sliding scale of sanity. Like general health you have to decided where to draw the line that marks the point past which you are officially sick. This line is in a different place for everyone and moves every time you try to measure it.
I poke the suspect object with a matchstick and dislodge a tiny sample which I sniff cautiously. Unfortunately it comes loose from the match and is drawn into my nasal cavity. It burns really badly and I hope very hard that it’s only mouse shit.
I met a cool girl at the shop today. What was her name? Store Assistant. Ahhhh.
Look, I can clean it for 10, 15 minutes every week. Or do an hour on a yearly basis. You do the arithmetic.
Are these your computer friends? I don’t know if I like to be categorised like that.
Aren’t you a little bit old for video games. Now why would an intelligent woman like you say something idiotic like that.
It is only through relating to yourself that you learn to relate to other people.
Even his choice of meals was slanted towards the youthful. Always lamb or veal. Or his ultimate indulgence. The egg.
I don’t have an oven. I have a nuclear furnace. You could use it to destroy super heroes.
I would have to apologise later to myself for performing such a demeaning action but needs must when the devil drives.
The people who tell you it pays to advertise. Those people are nearly always advertisers and not famous for their fealty to accurate reporting.
Your score puts you in the highest category of social reasoning. You will see ethical and moral values as important to the needs of society and will appeal to basic rights or values. You might say "Honesty is a standard which everyone should accept" or "Life is sacred."
Conformity to ethical norms is important to you, in terms of a responsibility, obligation or commitment for all individuals, although you may be willing to consider exceptions in some particular circumstances. You are likely to suggest that with entitlement or privilege comes responsibility.
You will appeal to considerations of responsible character or integrity in others, preferring a consistent or standard practice of behaviour in order to avoid damage to social institutions such as the legal system.
However, you will want to see an adjusted case-by-case application of standards for the sake of fairness to all people. Lastly, you are very likely to appeal to standards of individual or personal conscience, as well as of honour, dignity or integrity.
There’s a case on the table. He turns it around and opens it slowly. Now what’s in the case. That would be interesting. But how the case and I came to be here. That is truly intriguing.
In 1764 John Valdees approached a baggage maker in Hamburg to construct for him a travelling companion. Inside the case are postcards from everywhere the case has ever been. There is only one. For Hamburg. John Valdees was poisoned by a faulty gas lantern in his home, the night before his departure for pastures new.
I sat, legs slightly apart in a deep armchair. I had dressed as well as I could for this meeting.
You can have bunch of cunts A or you can have bunch of cunts B. It’s nice that you get to express your preference, but at the end of the day. You’re still going to end up with a bunch of cunts running the place.
Yes I know her. She’s one of the few positive arguments I’ve met for evolution.
Harder. Faster. Bigger. Better. Longer. Stronger. Tighter. Wetter.
It’s like walking into things, you know. If it didn’t hurt, people would just keep doing it.
I don’t have rules. I have guidelines.
I once met an Australian girl in a bar in Edinburgh. Hard to believe I know. And I told her the joke about koala bears being bad dates, because he eats, shoots and leaves. Miraculously she finds this funny and we end up back at her flat hanging out and her friend/flatmate comes home late in the evening, a little the worse for wear. Excitedly my new friend tells her the joke. Never have a koala for a boyfriend because he eats leaves and shits.
No matter what he does, the peculiar odour maintains.
The next time you feel like commenting on my noisy consumption of popcorn, pause for a moment and reflect on the fact that this is a comedy, and you laugh like a troop of bronchial baboons.
Now, you will eat a loaf of the bread you have baked. (Consequences)
We have to look a long way into the past for the origin of this situation. When the first guy, and we can be sure it was a guy, turned to the other people in his tribe and said I’m not going hunting today, I’ve decided to be the chief. Which means I get the biggest house, don’t work and you all give me stuff. And if anyone disagrees Chuckles here, the hardest guy in the village, who I have previously enlisted, will smash your head in with that rock, tied to a stick that he’s holding. Now if the entire village had looked at each other and thought, fuck that, and thrown them off the nearest precipice our society would have turned out entirely differently. Unfortunately, no one had the bottle to cooperate and so now we slog our guts out for our entire lives so that 50 rich people can spend all their time fucking about on yachts.
Guy sees a hot girl every week when he goes to the supermarket, catches her eye a couple of times. She works there. One day he has finally plucked up the courage to approach her when he notices that she’s coming over to him. They chat a bit, she asks if he’s single. He can’t believe this shit is happening. And she says yes, my brother’s gay as well, I think you’d really like him. So the guy says, okay. (because you know)
Does déjà vu happen more often in novel or familiar situations.
Mobile crane on a hill rolls away with two people in the basket.
Why are you scowling at that woman?
I’m trying to make her brain melt.
And what happens if you succeed?
Eh, she dies? I don’t know what the survival rate for post brain meltees is.
And then what? What about her family, her little dog who’ll starve, the old lady she takes cakes to on a Sunday. You’re just not thinking of the consequences. Short term.
Well, you know I didn’t think her brain was actually going to melt.
But you said you were really, really trying.
Yes, but with what I assumed to be absolutely no possibility of success.
So why do you try.
Well, you know. Just on the off chance.
Don’t expect anything and you won’t be disappointed.
On being chased by an incredibly pissed-off spider while cycling…
That would be like having your teeth drilled by a very attractive, naked woman.
<generic greeting>
<witty banter>
<mild insult>
<salutation with expletive>
<repeat mild insult>
There was the tiniest possible moment imaginable of pure fury on her face, an indivisible quantum of rage, naked in all its glory, and then it was gone, concealed by the same mechanism that nature uses to conceal a singularity from the universe at large.
Her expression reflected in a very direct way the struggles going on in her mind as she calculated the possible repercussions of her answer, but it was as difficult to interpret her expression as it was to fathom what was going on beneath a sheet which covered three people making passionate love. (Echoes)
They were the sort of nihilistic little monkeys I could do without, today of all days.
I tugged her hand like a little boy leading his mother astray.
Talking to a struggling musician. Maybe you could get into production or management.
Maybe you could get into an air tight plastic bag.
While I don’t like to do things the same way that other people might, if I found myself in a burning house I would still seek to escape. I’m not stupid. Right up the chimney to safety I would go.
(About his ex-wife) Our relationship began on unsafe foundations. She was blackout drunk and I had an erection the size of Texas.
There are two good friends in the story, one a handsome successful guy. He other has struggled his whole life, sickly, doesn’t have much. He gets some terminal illness. The handsome one confesses that he had always kept the other guy around because he seemed to soak up his bad luck. Making it real, the sick guy says he knew what was happening but he choose to stay around so he could be with his friend and ends up consoling the handsome guy because he will have to get by on his own from now on.
We were in a bar discussing the ease with which my friend could divine a person’s lot in life from the expression on their face. What about her I said, indicating an aging blonde who had just tottered in. “Taken roughly, from behind,” he replied.
We were making the same kind of progress the sea was making in its attempt to make the whole world an ocean once more, one wave at a time. Rock becomes pebble. Pebble becomes sand. Then the sand is stroked gently back, below the waves.
Her smile was a child’s nightlight, just enough of a glow to nudge the darkness a safe distance into the back of your mind, allowing you to get some sleep.
I found myself standing outside a class entitled, “Women’s Vegetarian Budget Cookery”, and I knew something in my life had to change.
I don’t get out very often. Well, that’s unfortunate. I had hoped that at least one of us would know what we were doing. (here)
…went crazy ape shit bonkers with the Industrial Solvent. End of a promising…
Nice ass. You can touch it if you want. She said nothing, but dropped lithely into the nearby armchair, one leg draped casually over the side.
His breakfast is prepared in a cold kitchen. (An unloved husband)
Bat wings snapping like sails in a high wind. (Thrumming)
February is an absent month. That’s why the calendar setters made it so short.
It’s amazing how easy it is for your whole day to slip away if you’re not paying attention. A sort, stroll, a visit to the bank and a meal and suddenly it’s time for bed. I’ve lost whole years because I wasn’t concentrating.
We live in the machine’s dream now.
A mother becomes ill. Her infant is in a play pen nearby. The mother in great distress crawls slowly to the door of their flat, which she manages to open. She calls weakly for help. Two men climbing the stairs hear her. Bundle her inside and rob her. The child grows up to be one of the characters.
You know, it’s like that film about the boat. It made a fuck load of money and lots of people really enjoyed it. But at the end of time when our civilisations cultural landmarks are discussed it won’t even make the list.
You talk about the end of time a lot. If there is one.
People assume evolution is some kind of progress. What if the specialisations it produces are just little eddies and blips on the entropic highway to the future’s blank cosmic soup.
That girl you were with last night wasn’t much of a looker. In a desert every flower is precious.
He prefers petite women because they make his cock seem bigger.
Have you got a shaver? Why? Because I want smooth skin against my lips when I kiss you goodbye.
A space is the place where time is stored.
I can see a better world. I just don’t know how to get there from here.
Use the molten drips from the charred frame as another dream. Sprinkled throughout the story. Perhaps he only dreams when he’s on his own.
Yes, I say these things and then I have to find some way to make them come true.
The first time you make a journey it seems longer because your brain is trying to map it. On subsequent trips down the same route you are only filling in blanks so your brain has less to do and the trip seems shorter.
You can have anger burning in you or you can have anger burned in you. You see there’s a difference.
In that moment for me, the wars of all the continents had ceased. Their grinding conflicts stilled.
A society that values money over life needs to have a long, hard rethink about its priorities.
What do you like about me most? The way your legs don’t quite meet at the top.
Spiralling down like a seed with no wind.
Like when you hear a piece of music that echoes the gaps between your heartbeats.
The statue on the TV, that’s my wife and child.
I won’t lie; it’s hard to see past your personality.
A rabbit caught in the landing lights of a descending airliner.
I felt as though I was showing flowers to morons.
Some days you just can’t piss straight.
Communitas.
Sorry about the tears, but the revolutions here.
Harder, faster, bigger, better, longer, stronger, tighter, wetter.
The gentle pull of inhalation then a wall of air seeking escape.
Look son, a fire engine painted red, lights flashing and siren blares. “That means someone’s house is on fire.”
Tears of molten glass fall from the icicles of shattered glass hanging from the charred window frame.
Nicotine stained hair.
How can you say what you are saying with that expression?
Trapped like a baby in a bottle bank.
I find it very difficult to conduct a reasoned argument when you have adopted such a position of indefensible stupidity.
Like a smile from a lifted veil.
A place is the space where time is stored
Stop looking at the sky ya silly cunt and enjoy your walk. Away and bile yer heid. Actual exchange between a loving couple on Dickson Street..
The accidental breaking of an apparently trivial object triggers an outpouring of grief completely out of proportion with the item lost, like a damn breaking.
An inverse psychic is someone who broadcasts what they are thinking and their ideas to all the otherwise psychically opaque people around them. This is especially funny if they are strongly opinionated. Not necessarily connected by distance. Could there be some way to use them as an unwitting spy.
I phoned an automated insurance claim line, got exasperated and said a special word, which let me into a secret thing.
A very short film that looks like a home movie filmed by the narrator, who arrives at the airport and then takes a cab into the city. Arrives at a friends house, there’s the flash of a knife as the screen goes black. Some people have been killed and they are seen upside down as the killer walks out holding the camera in his hand, no longer filming dlinerately. He can say things to the cabby on the way in from the airport that foreshadow the moider.
The biggest kid in the sandpit mentality is frankly embarrassing.
Recruitment fair films for QMU etc.
Use the words shabby and minx and interweb.
An old woman with a stick is walking along oblivious to the carrier bags wrapped round the bottom of her stick by the wind, or that she has picked up on her travels.
Being inside an ambulance is like being inside a giant first aid kit.
The wire pad bristle of my father’s hug, shoulders stiffened (coated, varnished) by years of hairspray overspill lacquered on to control his comb-over.
Spoofed p2p files that induce vomiting and hysteria.
Woman on the bus with the plastic hair protector. With dead flies falling out from underneath it. Killed by her hairspray.
Anvil of Stars, adapted screenplay.
The irony of mistyping type and getting typo.
Now I appreciate what doctors and nurses do. They have a difficult job and if it hardens them to chisel sharpness that’s just one of the side effects they have to live with but it should be noted that the healthcare industry has a vested interest in people being sick.
Always seek medical attention at the earliest possible opportunity. If your driving a car and you hear a rattle you can drive straight to the garage and get the twenty pence washer replaced, or you can keep driving the car until the transmission falls off.
What AICN posters have to realise is that their opinions do not manifest themselves in reality. Saying a film is bad does not make it so. You can say you didn’t like a film and be entirely correct or I did mot enjoy the movie for blah reasons. But you shouldn’t really describe anything as bad unless it’s a hairy apple.
Language is a virus in the sense that once one person has become infected everyone else has to acquire it in order to understand what is being said.
Why do they do movie charts on box office rather than number of tickets sold?
So have you ever paid for sex. Um, a couple of times. It was one of those things you know. One of those things that happened more than once. A woman paid me for sex once. She said I reminded her of her son.
You just couldn’t describe it as small and be accurate.
When he blinks his sunglasses go dark.
Rich people’s lives are deep, empty holes, pits that they find themselves standing at the bottom of. They look up and they can see the light but they are too stupid to climb. So they shout and whine for everyone else to throw money down to them so they can stand on it. And this raises them up a little. But the money is like leaves, the longer they have it the dryer it gets. It withers with age and turns to dust and they find themselves sinking back down again, so they call for more and more money. By the end of their lives their still standing at the bottom of a pit, the dust has risen over their heads and they can’t even see the light anymore. And they die, alone in the darkness. If they had only used the leaves to make compost they could have grown. They would still have been standing in a hole, but at least their heads would have been in the light. But rich people don’t grow they absorb. Like infinite sponges.
Program idea. The Short Film Show. Like the Blue Room or similar. People send in short films and they get shown. Could have some people discuss them afterwards. Could have short interviews with the film makers about their inspiration. Filmmakers could film their own interviews.

I stared in slack jawed silence, waiting for an appropriate response to swim up from the depths of my subconscious.
A net, which is made to catch things is actually a series of holes joined together.
Do a study of the different attitudes that children have had a pet that died and children that haven’t, have to death.
Asking a blind man for directions. A guy on the corner with shades and a stick. He says, go up the road until you hear all the ladies talking in the hairdresser. Reach out with your left hand, there will be a lamp post. Walk straight across until you smell the fishmongers and then turn right pause now and then and you’ll feel a blast of hot air from the laundry. It’s two doors down from that. If you notice a big crack in the pavement then you’ve gone too far.
Do English books get translated into American?
You can’t sit down to a banquet for every meal and still expect there to be food in the larder.
She was the brightest star in the firmament.
It was so polished there was nothing left but sheen.
He opened the door with slow precision. Cord tight muscles sliding under an expensive silk shirt.
Grounded by shapes moving.
Memory thieves.
I had the feeling that she would be a particularly frisky mount.
It has been a long ramshackle day.
We are heading towards a consumer implosion where the populace are so well trained to consume that advertising will no longer be required. It will be more a question of access.
I’ve had an occasional recurring fantasy about helping out a homeless girl with the offer of a hot meal and a warm bath. She of course is grateful in a sexual manner. I know it’s a little bit reprehensible but she always ends up stealing my money and slitting my throat.
At some indeterminate point in the future, recomes will be pensed.
The phjilo whatever loop in your brain that allows you to talk to yourself seems to fight back when you try not to use it. Perhaps that has some significance.
I’ve always thought that standing around in bars drinking and talking shite to people I don’t know or respect was my true vocation. The closest I’ve ever come to making a carreer out of it was the film industry. Although my time there was short lived due to its inherent lack of creativity or moral fibre.
What kind of fucking tree is that. I don’t know I’m not an ornithologist. Ornithologists don’t study trees you clown they study birds. And where do the fucking birds live.
He recorded his demise with a poet’s voice.
Suffering is caused by desire and regret. You can work to eliminate desire. The only thing you can do about regret is try not to repeat the mistakes that led you to feel it.
There’s a room or a bar full of people talking on mobile phones completely ignoring the people who are in the same physical space. A couple of the may actually be talking to someone else in the same room and suddenly they feel oncomfortable and one of them has to leave. What is the etiquette of this situation.
It’s an interesting theory but not one I think proper scientific investigation will validate.
The way I reassure myself that other people are conscious is when they act like selfish arseholes. Like cats.
I like wearing heals they make me feel sexy. Well they make you walk like a duck on stilts. Or a baby giraffe.
Frequently, I seem to remember the future. Not in any great detail but impressions that are simultaneously novel and familiar. I have read that these moments are caused by the brain taking a shortcut and looping a signal round so the part that remembers things gets the information before the part that does the interpretation. Mr. Deacon seemed to cause this to happen a lot.
When I first met him it was a nothing show he was scouring for cheap canvas. He screamed spittle into the face of a waitress until she cried. I do not think he was even angry, just playing the part he had created for himself in the unfolding tableaux. Trying to leave his mark in whatever way possible. Even if it was Tipex on a Rembrandt.
I propose a new democratic system where you vote for the fat prick you definitely don’t want to have representing you. So the candidate with the least votes is the winner.
Its one of those lessons I have learned 4 or 5 times.
One day I will sneak in and rub cake on your lips.
I have often entertained the possibility, although never when sober, that we may all actually be the same person. That is too say, there is some energy or spirit that interfaces with reality through the medium of our bodies and it is this being who provides the impression of a mind inhabiting our bodies. Our different personalities are a product of the slight differences between each of our bodies. But we are all actually one and the same consciousness, in a similar manner to the possibly somewhat fanciful notion that there is only really one electron in the whole universe, jumping madly about through space and time fulfilling all of its obligations.
As deadly as the dew from the leaves of the Tiger Lilly (lilium tigrinum).
Imagine a world in which a gaggle of corporate entities have to band together to pool their resources, in an attempt to protect themselves and their interests from the damaging commentary of a small internet site that specialises in parody and satire.
She could only have been more oblivious to my existence by being unconscious.
There are two ways to win in any given situation. Either your opponent can fuck up, thereby giving you victory by default or, and this is my preferred method, you opponent can give the performance of their lives, scaling new heights of achievement. And then you beat them anyway. Obviously there’s a lot of grey area in their and no consideration of fortune smiling on one party or the other but I’ve never believed in fate. I believe in opportunity.
There is a cloud of bacteria floating in space and every year the earth passes through it and this is what causes flu season.
I walked into the hostile bar and experienced a sudden sense of dislocation.
He’s the kind of irritating fool who degrades the quality of life of all right minded people. And I don’t mean right politically.
My computer literate friend once wrote a word processing macro which would scan a piece of copyrighted text and paraphrase it into something freely distributable.
In a similar manner to the great pant dilemma. After swimming or exercise so vigorous you have chosen to remove your pants you return to your locker to discover a pair of pants that look exactly the same as yours lying on the bench, where you may well have left them. And sure enough on further investigation you find that yours are not in your locker. Well do you wear them? Do you fuck. As soon as your pants have been out of your control for more than the briefest of moments, they cease to be yours for obvious reasons of safety and cleanliness. You should look on them as pants which look just the same as the pair you used to have. Never try to extend this theory be exchanging the pants for children.
It was good. So I did a little dance.
There once was a businessman who’s shady practices were about to be uncovered so he concocted a truly outlandish conspiracy theory and predicted that he would soon be the victim of a vicious smear campaign to punish him for revealing the truth and to discredit anything else he may have to say.

You know they add sedatives to petrol, burned and distributed into the atmosphere of every major urban centre by hordes of oblivious accomplices.
How do reporters decide the difference between an incident and a disaster for example? I heard during the war many references to friendly fire ‘incidents’, where there were actually more casualties than the challenger ‘disaster’.
The abandoned car had been sitting outside my apartment for some time with the radio blaring. I finally reached the end of my tether and called the police. “I want to report someone with appallingly bad taste in music.”
She epitomised what he always looked for in a woman; the mind of a fourteen year old in the body of a fifteen year old.
You know you can’t hear rust. Some forms of decay are a hidden process.
There is something very childlike and innocent about her. Specifically the way her motor functions aren’t integrated with her consciousness.
The oblivion club. Fabulously rich men go there. They are drugged and wake up later with a few interesting symptoms to hand a fantasy of what happened around.
I’ve heard people say that the secret rulers of the earth skulk in their secret cavern far from prying eyes. If you look there your looking in the wrond direction. They live high above in the hills and at the top of tall buildings, far away from the base earth that provides their sustenance as possible. Birds of prey perched on cliff tops surveying the cattle below.
I think it would be a trifle optimistic to describe us as a couple.
You can try and steal her. If she goes she has no taste and I don’t want her anyway. Or words to that effect.
She had a voice that could grate cheese.
In most elections I have the option of giving my mandate to bunch of cunts A, who don’t care what I think. Or bunch of cunts B, who don’t care what I think. Basically it comes down to which letter I prefer.
He once deliberately infected himself with a contagious disease so that the decontamination team would come round and strip his wall paper. That is how much he hated interior decoration.
In their sad, miserable little lives, the hard seed of hate for anyone who is different is the only thing that prevents them from putting a bullet through their vacuous slope fronted skulls.
Imagine a politician who worked for the people. To the corporate leeches who infest our planet he would be just as annoying and unpleasant as most of us find normal politicians. Maybe some corporate guy could have an overheard rant about Politician X.
Politicians have an extraordinarily difficult job. And they do it very badly.
Like the game of scissor roulette we used to play in college. Where you spin spin the scisssors on your finger and then fall forward on top of them. Sometimes you get the handle and sometimes you get the point. And sometimes you get a broken finger.
The character who takes his girlfriend home to meet the familyt and it turns out she looks exactly like his sister. Or the character goes with the girl to meet her folks and he looks exactly like her father. Her parents don’t seem to notice but the dad says what a handsome chap he is.
A robot with a goldfish bowl in its stomach.
He will die, oh, he will, die.
Do you mean she killed, and ate him?
Inevitably, beer was spilled.
There’s nothing wrong with a glacial pace when you are grinding mountains to dust.
He’s a little brand monkey.
Live the life that you’ve got. Not the one you think you should have.
The only thing that would hurt as much would be acid in an eyedropper.
The conspiracy of the opticians.
Representative democracy has failed. They think they are in power when they are supposed to be enacting the will of the people. Look at how many MPs get elected with less than half of the votes cast never mind less than 50% of the electorate. How about an election where you vote for the person you do not want to win and the candidate with the least votes is the victor. It is reminisant of the period when the Kings and Queens of Europe made the subtle shift from caretaker to owner. (steward to monarch)
I can never find anyone to whom I wish to give the mandate of my vote.
Financial considerations preclude the giving of gifts at this time.
Two men in red boiler suits emerge from the darkness. The one on the left carries a lumberjack’s Perspex face mask. I squeeze between them and one of the anonymous glass fronted office buildings which line the pavement.
I have come to believe that the man living in the flat opposite is actually me in the future.
A bloke who is up to something dodgy discovers that his shenanigans are about to be uncovered so he makes up some ridiculous conspiracy theory and says that some evidence will be fabricated to discredit him. And of course it does.
Years later each of the people who contributed received a bottle with a little drawing of a child inside. A fragment of the kindness they had shown the old woman returned to them.
Because she was high on cough medicine.
It would be as though you had invited a shark to a smorgasbord.
Hoist by his own petard.
I could not remember the man at all, which I looked upon as something of a blessing.
I tell her she needs makeup like a racehorse needs an extra leg and reach around to open her robe but she slips away and leaves me staring in the mirror cheeks flushed red, breathing fast and shallow.
He went down like a two dollar hooker.
The kind of fellow who would choose the classic gun to temple suicide and would get off two shots.
I think there must be some social hardwiring that dictates you will always find someone in a group to favour and someone in a group to disparage. No matter what their merits.
The mistake many people make is to assume that a crisis will be followed by a period of peace and calm. When in reality the crisis only stops just below the threshold for further turmoil. And the slightest little thing can kick it all off again.
Do not assume that a large action will have a large impact. The random nature of the suituation dictates that the more small events you instigate the higher the potential for one of them to spiral out of control. Hitting one of the fingers of instability that would ripple out across society.
A lot of the time I am just not interested in what other people are saying. And they sense that.
There were three deaf guys round a table in the bar. I do not know what they were saying but I guess it concerned the barmaid. And I must say signing can be very expressive.
Dogs are beggars. Cats are pirates.
If only she could have found her shoes.
I could see him through the train windows invisible in the darkness between carriages.
Routine is not essential but it takes away some of the indecision.
It became comfortable in the same way an old friends favourite joke stops being about the joke and ends up being two friends talking.
It was like shooting an arrow into the air and painting a target where it lands.
Which one of you bitches would like to dance.
Complexity theory. Find the sensitive spot and whack it. Piss on a fault line.
I might pop down later and make a lightning raid on your pantry.
I suspected that our situation had become untenable when it transpired that my partner's exit strategy involved leaning out of an express train and going teeth first into some very solid Victorian masonry. A fatal last kiss on the mouth of a tunnel. The last thing he heard, the white noise of wind and some fuck complaining about the open window.
Today is his funeral. If there was an option I would rather have my teeth drilled than attend or go to fluffer school.
My reasearch led to a series of revelations. Like a bad film, waking up from a dream. Then, surprise, waking up from the dream. Then surprise waking up from the dream. And on, until the situation is so ludicrous that delirium is the only possibility. And then the surprise is that you are already awake.
Like a deaf mouse being considered brave.
Using a crutch will make you lame.
It was more like wrestling than making love.
Lets face it there is a whole world of idiocy out there. All they are really concerned with are their tribal pigskin rituals.
He was on his knees but not begging.
He was in full vestidual lizard brain mode.
There was no joy at the end. Just a dull release. A terminal patient whose options for treatment are exhausted. No blaze of glory. Just a dim bulb extinguished.
I once phoned my answering machine to leave myself a reminder. It was two days before I recognised the strangers voice on the tape.
My grandmother had a drawer that I would explore every weekend, abandoned by shopping parents. No matter how often I delved there was always a new treasure to discover. An analogue for a happy life.
There is something about being naked and wet that makes even the most adequate looking woman appealing.
Some people triumph through talent and ability. Some people triumph through perseverence. And some people just triumph.
Fudge sucking murder puppies.
My all time favourite was the time I thought I had gone blind in one eye because I had blown snot out through my tear duct.
Now that was a proper cold.
Take karaoke for example. Some people think its fun and I think it is an indication of the end of all reason. Where people who should not drink meet people who should not sing.
We only had a little snow last week but it hung around for ages transforming Edinburgh's cobbled streets into a slippy slidey ice world.
When I lived out in the country every pavement (sidewalk) would have been covered in grit within a couple of hours of the first snowflake landing but for some reason it just does not seem to happen in the city. I guess they expect the car exhaust fumes to melt it or something.
what if we are each discreet switching assemblies swapping between different personalities in different universes like a processor running task slices In the same way that computer operating systems can simulate a virtual machine for each of the programs running, what if each of us is
In the future the police will bill you for being investigated even if you are innocent or not even directly involved.
When an earthquake starts it has no idea how big it will become.
There are all sorts of little fissures of discontent running through the strata of society and in the same way that an earthquake does not know how large it will be when it begins, a revolution can have the least significant of beginnings. So I had decided to concentrate on starting as many little fires as possible, in the hope that one of them would rage out of control. Rather than expending all my efforts on one grand gesture that would have the Feds coming round to spank me.
Like the book I wrote a long time ago, called Stimulus/Response, where I sent the most outlandish statements I could concoct to the letters pages of various newspapers and journals, and collected the reactions of the readers. I am sure the book would have been more successful if, as I had expected, people had disagreed with my stated viewpoints. But unfortunately for my sales, I ended up with a long list of missives from insane cranks saying how right even my most reactionary proposals were.
I don’t appreciate threats, whether implied or explicit, unless they are of such outlandish grandeur that they become impossible to ignore.
Are you aware that you only ever bend over like a stripper. (Legs dead straight, feet wide apart)
Ever walk down a familiar street and notice a door you’ve never seen before. Ever play a well worn CD and hear some music you’ve never noticed.
You have two choices in life: you can stay single and be miserable, or get married and wish you were dead."
The oppressors don’t care anymore. I mean they’ve never really cared but they did at least used to pretend. A nice meal before the rape. For us, it’s like having the fact that you’re ugly flung in your face. As long as no-one mentions it, it’s something that can be ignored. But now it’s out in the open and unavoidable. We are the sheep and they are the sheep dogs. The shepherds of course still remain hidden.
What does the future hold? We can either stay on the course we’re on and live our empty lives like cattle. Consuming and producing on demand. Forever at the mercy of economic planners, the government and their corporate masters. Or we can dig our heels in the way we used to getting dragged to church, whining and moaning all the way to puberty when it finally gets too much for your parents and you are left to wallow in the vast emptiness of Sunday. We need to grow up as a civilisation, get through those troubled teenage years and get to the creative blossom of our twenties. When we still have the energy but also enough perspective to avoid running around like headless chickens trying to do everything at once. (Civilisation as life)
They think they are in power when they are supposed to be in representation.
The guy seemed okay. No obvious mutations.
This is the last voice you will ever hear.
We’re all temps in the great office of life.
Have you ever noticed how the prospect of embarrassment is always much worse than the embarrassment itself.
Stevie is an adequate musician at best. But he is well off now, having come across some very early demos by a famous band who shall remain nameless, on the floor of his dealers kitchen. Mustering all the musicality he at his disposal he cobbled together an album of knock offs and released it first. The famous band who shall remain nameless chose to pay him off rather than face accusations of plagiarism or go to all the trouble of writing some new songs. The dealer connection would have been too embarrassing for them to reveal.
Things you don’t want to hear while you’re on the job.
You know you remind me so much of my father.
A couple are in a bar. At the next table a man scribbles in his notebook and berates the barstaff for their poor service. The man announces he is going to the toilet and demands that his table be protected/kept. One of the couple slips over consumed by curiosity about the notebook. They return. It either says I knew you’d look. Or, if they don’t turn this music off I’m going to hang the barmaid with her own intestines. There can be a call back to a news item about this or they could even find the barmaid. There is no music in the bar. Maybe it could be something more profound/mundane. Shopping list?
This empty vacuous meaningless existence is not what I want.
Who was that?
A girl I used to work with.
You didn’t seem to be on particularly good terms.
I have a Restraining Order against her.
For a moment I’m not sure if she’s joking.
She used to steal my milk. She was convinced that some people got good milk and some got bad. She thought that because I had a partner and a nice apartment I was on the good milk list. So she decided to escape her fate by stealing mine, usurping the natural order of things.
And who did she think made up the list. Decided whether your life was cream off the top or watery UHT?
I never asked her.
Apart from the psychosis she is very attractive.
You know for some people that’s not always enough.
Why can I say faecal matter on television and not shite?
Helen, mousy, but good bones. Carrying a little too much water this time of the month. Shy and skittish, like trying to hand feed a wild deer.
The setting sun dries my tears to tight patches of skin and I turn away, without hesitation.
Matched cut from a billowing umbrella in super slow mo to a jellyfish or vice versa. When someone walks with an umby up it wibbles in a very similar manner.
A book called toilet tales, filled with short stories that are just long enough to read when doing a poo that you finish before your legs go numb.
Reaching into a pool or mirror and being stopped by your own reflection, instead of feeling the surface of the water or the cold smoothness of glass, you feel your own finger tips.
I create t shirts and clothes that impress in inadequate lighting situations.
Handsome and vacuous. It’s not the best combination but it could have been worse.
The red on her cheeks was no longer the ruddy glow of good health but the permanent burst blood vessels of a life of hard slaps.
Gedankenexperiment thought experiment.
Memories are plastic, when you recall something you can change it before it goes back into storage. Imagine learning a fact from text book a, you review this information later in textbook b and it’s a little different. If you study much later for exams with text book c which presents the information differently. When you come to answer the exam question which answer do you give.
The thing Duncan said about deja vue meaning you find yourself doing things you seem to have done before. He thought this was a sign that your life was on the right track. But I thought it could also be that you were repeating the same mistakes that you had made before. There is also the idea that as you get older you tend to do things that are similar to things you have done many times before and this is the reason you get the impression that you’ve experienced something before. Because you have.
A well educated population is the enemy of easy government. (Because the first and most important thing a well educated person should have learned is enquiry.)
Your eyes see nothing without the light.
Of course I think about what I’m writing. I have to translate the thoughts in my head into something intelligible to other people. It would take a team of specialists, semanticians, philosophers and archeologists, working day and night, months to render comprehensible the rambling squall of synaptic misfires dribbled onto the pages of my notebook if I didn’t do some distillation before hand. And most of that would be junk. Writing for me is like trying to pin butterflies from a cloud, in the correct order, to the page, with one hand tied behind my back and my eyes closed. If I’m writing about something I am familiar with it’s the same but instead of having my eyes closed I wear dark glasses.
Now, that was something I had forgotten I was trying to remember. Rather than something I had forgotten to remember to forget.
She held up her hand, shaking slightly, up to my face. Wedding band prominently displayed.
I’m married.
It doesn’t make you invisible, I replied.
It wasn’t the kind of reassurance I needed. Like going to the hospital for some corneal work and being told that at no point was your eye removed entirely from its socket.
As we get older the people we’re attracted to should also be more mature. Although for men the scale is clearly not linear. But if you miss out on a relationship with a particular age group it can knock your progress off track. And your attention keeps getting drawn back to the demographic you skipped, however far you’ve progressed down the line.
A successful thirty something gets married to another thirty something. He had a girlfriend at university and some teenage fumbles at school, but all through his twenties he was too busy making money for anything that lasted more than two and a half hours, including dinner. So he always finds himself looking back at the hard bodied twenty somethings and the club. And in his head is an empty box needing to be ticked. Could this also explain some peado behavior. Those lost little boys who no-one chased in the playground left with an empty space inside.
Difficult visual gag to put in a book. Stumpy wheelchair guy is always in the vicinity. Then casually mention that he’s dead. “He didn’t smell as much as usual. And that’s how we knew.”
The difference between a 13 year old and a 14 year old is huge because of the rate of growth. The older people get the less difference a small age difference makes. Eventually becoming negligible.
Fast food, quick cook meals and microwaves are great. They give you so much more time to sit in front of the TV watching adverts for fast foods, quick cook meals and microwaves.
In many people I can see a desperation that wasn’t there even a year ago. Out on the streets on a Friday night people seem to be trying a little too hard. A slightly crazed need to fill the emptiness in their souls with something. Drink, drugs, fucking. Whatever. I think that partly it’s because they realize that TIC (those in charge) have crossed a line. They have stopped pretending that we matter. That we are anything other than a commodity to be managed. They used to disguise their actions, finessing the publics view of a given situation. But now they don’t seem to care because they think there is nothing we will do about it. Sedated by the entertainment industry. A sleight of hand relieving us of the lives we could have led. Bled slowly dry of our vitality to feed their Global Military Industrial Complex. In their perfect world we would go from couch to job and back until we die. Ordering everything on home shopping and paying for it with credit.
Usury is a sin, but only for the lender.
When a car honks in the street some people turn to look and some people just walk on. There are people with a lot of friends who look because there is a good chance it might be someone they know. Some people don’t look because they have no friends and know they won’t know the honker. There are other people who have no friends who will look anyway out of sheer desperation, often waving in a transparent attempt to convince themselves and others that there is a point to their existence and they shouldn’t just take a step forward and end it all under the number 38. And there are people who have lots of friends who don’t look because they are busy with the friends around them.
If I was right about everything I would insist. Fortunately I have been incredibly wrong in the past about a variety of things and used this perspective to great effect at that moment.
Out on the giddy edge.
Is that the same sound you make when your brother is fucking you.
Out of body experience people always seem to go towards the light. That makes them like moths. Maybe that’s what moths are.
And then it was almost like psychically he heard my minds squeal of anguish. And he closed the blinds.
Famous Haiku guy said life is walking on the roof of hell looking at flowers.
You are testing the limits of acceptable delay. Or. You are pushing the boundaries of acceptable delay.
Have you taken to avoiding me incase the loser’s stink rubs off.
I don’t enjoy having to be nice to people I don’t like. It makes me feel very superficial.
A woman goes to clean her teeth while talking to someone outside the bathroom. She takes her gum out. Cleans her teeth then pops it back in as she leaves. Get the toothbrush out your face and let’s get moving.
I have seen the bright lights from below the turning tide.
During the fezza almost all the scots leave to make more room for tourists. They leave behind a crack team who rush from place to place pretending to be the population. Funnier if it was just one guy. Yeah its me, I’m the population of Edinburgh.
A young couple are in the park courting when a freak bolt of lightning welds their clasped hands together.
If you make a film or tell a story without humour then you have made something without people
Songs played on the magical guitar come true.
I climbed to the top of Sailor’s Peak, I was looking for the sea.
Stain the clothes of litter louts, We will clean the gutters out.
Raise your hand if you felt like an old man running into a wall.
The only thing everyone could agree on was that we were fucked.
Her stature is regal but what about grace. You can’t have it all in the one place.
The paraphraser macro that goes through whole novels doing just that.
Using the word dislocation to meen in the wrong place.
She had a slightly fictional air. Someone’s idea of a bookseller. Preppy clothes, flat shoes, but not too sensible. Long hair gathered but barely contained, ready to (be unleashed) spill free in a moment of passion. And the delightful accent, soft and well educated but using words like shy. (to mean short change)
He nearly broke his neck doing a whip pan to check her rear aspect as she passed.
A man in the woods falls into a hole or is otherwise trapped. As his condition deteriorates he flashes back to the events leading up to his visit to the woods. Eventually it turns out that he had just buried his murdered wife nearby.
How do you know all this.
Hours of experience.
You say lightning doesn’t strike twice, but if you saw an area covered in birdshit would you stand there secure in the knowledge that it would be a statistical anomaly for one more load of bird poop to splat on your baldy noggin.
He paws her in that enthusiastic but inaccurate way that drunk people (men) consider erotic (foreplay)
If you were doing it you could make it as shitty as you wanted. But I’m doing it and I have certain standards to maintain.
It’s difficult for me to express just how much I doubt that.
Command we are in range of the objective. Awaiting orders to proceed. (I think this was intended for the start of Loose Cannon missions.
The Buddha didn’t like what he said to be written down because once commited to paper they became prone to interpretation. His idea was for information to be passed on verbally from mentor to pupil with the mentor clearing up any confusion as they went along. An unbroken chain back to the source.
Were you asleep.
Dosed off. Passed out. What’s the difference.
The difficulty of meeting your oriental girlfriend in a Chinatown bar. They all look the same to you.
Close up of water surface showing a slight reflection and the tiles at the bottom of the pool. The surface of the water starts to ripple, becoming regular as breathing on the soundtrack becomes more obvious.
Being so desperate to attract someone’s attention in the street that you throw a pen at them. Something like. I saw her every day for a week and not once did she even glance in my direction. So I resorted to drastic measures. (If there was a space here or change of scene, police station and he’s talking to someone else, but it seems like the same conversation.You threw a pen at her?
Imagine I had a car and over the course of a year I gradually replaced every part. At the end of the year would it still be the same car. That is what happens to your body over an eight year period.
Go over and do the old mother daughter gag. Yeah cool, and if it doesn’t work I can always plead irony.
You can’t keep pleading irony whenever you say something stupid.
You hurt your leg and you go to the doctor and for a little while you are in a wheelchair. You go and do physio and your leg mends and then you stop using the wheelchair. What happens with your eyesight though. You go to an optician and he gives you glasses, which make your eyes weaker. So you go back the next year and get new, stronger glasses that make your eyes weaker. And on and on and on. If opticians gave out wheelchairs, you would start with a bare metal one you have to push yourself, than after a few years you’d be in a super plush motorised one you control with a straw, having paid for both of them and all the intervening models. They are worse than crack dealers. A continual detrimental slide to myopia.
The price we pay for understanding is awareness.
Subtle distinction, are adverts there to persuade you that you should buy a certain type of product, ie a car. Or are they there to persuade you to buy a product and that it should be this particular one?
A blind person gets some experimental eye surgery done that includes little micro detectors or some element of technology, which allows them to see into some other realm.
Touching other people is important, it reinforces the notion that they are real and not just figments of your imagination wandering through a mental construct.
If you follow in the footsteps of giants you don't walk taller, you walk shorter because you are in their footsteps and being giants they have a very heavy stride.
If a simulation is so complete that you can't tell the difference between it and reality then in what way is reality better?
Do you ever glance at a clock and catch the second hand not moving?
Someone waking from a dream to find some element of the dream has carried over in to reality. Like the drunk outside shouting about something that was in the dream.
A mental illness in the Oliover Sachs vein where the patient believes they are repeating a life they have lived exactly as before. Perhaps it's just part of getting older when almost everything you do each days is something you have already done so many times before.
Other Sachs illnesses like the person who believes someone they know has been replaced by an exact replica. Or all the people they know. Or that they themselves are the replica.
When Euclid described the perfect curve, your hips where what was being talked about.
An amnesiac woman finds out that she is actually a post op transexual.
People don't think about evolution not related to animals enough. The clothes horse that I use has evolved in symbiosis with my washing machine and holds almost exactly one load, give or take a couple of garments.
That's quite a hankering for a devout vegetarian. It's not a religion, it's a dietary choice.
Ask the sea because it changes.
I tend to observe life more than participate in it.
Everything in our relationship was implied rather than explicit.
A person in a flat suspects that someone is lurking outside. They kneel at the letterbox, which they open to allow them to see out. A long knife or similar object sticks in their eye. The assailant then pulls the knife out, causing the victims head to bump against the door before they fall backwards out of shot.
There will come a point in the future when your life is so efficiently organised and your time so successfully managed that you don't actually have to be around for it to continue. And then your relationships with other people become the same.
A squad game where you buy the software that is used to control/communicate with the team. So the manual and packaging are geared towards this conceit. Login, email etc. After failures you have to redeploy with new troops and the bodies of the last lot could litter the battlefield.
Ever walk down a familiar street and see a door you've never noticed before. Ever play a well worn cd and hear a piece of music you've never noticed before.
Matched cut from a wobbling umbrella toa jellyfish. Umbrellas in slow mo billow just like jellyfish.
LIFESAVERS a bit like intacto but they steal events from your life. Like your marriage or your first kiss.
Compromised position.
If you look stupid, then your on the list.
If you talk stupid, then your on the list.
The phone rang and I had it to my ear before the first trill had finished. Choked off like a murdered budgie. I listened to the voice on the other end of the line. There were a few important words and a lot of padding. I hung up without speaking. Outside I hailed a cab. I need a cashline and a pub in that order. Any particular establishment in mind, sir? One that's open now and will continue to be open for some time.
A ghost film where the ghosts move fast and drain heat. They are semi solid so they can get a hold of you and freeze the part they're holding off. 28 Days style non horror horror.

Copying analogue things faster than they play. Synchronised. You cand go as fast as you want as long as they are together.

Compression, when you make something take less space what does it lose?

I created a monster but the monster can dance.

Art doesn’t have to exist to be effective.

This idea first germinated many years ago after a boozy mid morning festival radio project launch. If you have ever attended the Edinburgh Internatonal Film Festival or Fringe you will be aware of how awash the city is in AM drinking. After the launch ran out of gratis drinks we retired to the Pear Tree, where the sun was beating down on the beer garden for once. After a lengthy discussion on the continued use of various racial epithets when referring to a type of shop or takewaay. Our attention turned to the decoupling of presentation form content. Initially focussing on ways in which a sensible idea could be presented badly then extending that to the case wher an idea, in this case the universal declaration of human rights was rendered incomprehensible by translating it into morse code. While coming up with different ways to present the dots and dashes. The idea emerged of returning them to text but in a different form, in this case dots would be the word fuck and dashes would be cunt.
