# Stoic


Alan

Showed your piece ‘the changing face of Armadale?’ to the boys one night
before I left—hope you don’t mind—it went down well. Nobody guessed
‘Armadale’ but a few came close (in a manner of speaking) with
‘Australia?’ and ‘Florida?’

‘Been pondering our conversation, in particular your trees. I had missed
something that resonates with something that I have been thinking towards.

Let me start with the Greek word Logos, one of the few I can actually
recognize in its native garb (λόγος), it might set things up nicely.

The usual (Anglo/Christian) translation ‘The Word’ (ala John) captures
no more than half of what the Stoics, and other more mystically inclined
Greeks like ol’ Heraclitus, meant by the word. Logos, to them, was not
just ideas and words and their governing logic and grammar but also the
actual phenomena in nature that these words and ideas represented and
the governing logic and grammar of the Universe itself. Logos, to the
Stoics, was reason in both senses of the word.

I see logos as pattern: both the pattern to the stuff in the universe
and the pattern to our abstract representations of it. I sense some
relationship between these patterns but can’t quite get my head around
it… Which brings me to your trees.

When I was trying to grasp your tree planting and grabbed hold of the
idea that you were trying to achieve the effect of a work of art without
the actual work of art, I was subtly haunted by the sense that I was
missing something obvious… On the bus home (buggers cancelled the
trains) the ghost caught up. There was a work of art — the words. You
were doing poetry, no?

When this clicked and the echo of your language also caught me up
(condensed, pithy etc.) It struck the chord with one of my logos
inspired musings. Which is, in a word: compression.

Sometimes, when I squint just right, I see everything as compression:
The core theory of physics — reality.tar; poetry — AnExperience.rar; a
human being — one unique, evolving thread in a massively parallel
compression program.

Here is one I zipped earlier:

[I think] The Word is the signal in the noise that the universe makes as
it folds itself into our understanding of the unfolding universe.

A question for you: It is easy (at least for me) to see poetry and prose
as compression (some aspect of outer space reduced and captured into
some ‘pithy’ seed that can grow back in inner space), do you think the
same holds for visual art (at least the representational stuff?)

Enjoyed your conversation, I miss them, and would be happy if they were
less infrequent.

Cheers,
Allan

No worries. Scott mentioned it in passing when I caught up with him and Dave at the comicon.

The sites had a wee bit of a tidy up but I still need to figure out how to run the bands updating with different timings. They all update after 2 seconds just now but I'd like them to be independent. Don't feel that duplicating the function code 4 times is the way forward though.

Added a little gravity simulator that will make decisions for you once I add some bubbles that say Leave, Stay and Drink. Also need to work out point to circle collisions. Endless learning.

Yes, was a good chat but wish I'd gone lower strength on the beer. There's some fuzzy sections in my recollection I just won't get back.

Also out of practice. Not much of that sort of talk on a Thursday so felt like an out of shape athlete drafted in for one last race. Fine on the straights but its a steeple chase and someone slaps a big fence here and there on the track.

Read up on logos, a term I had heard (probably in the Matrix movies) but wasn't too clear on. Seems like there's a few interpretations depending on the perspective you are coming from.

Is the idea that it's a bi-directional intermediary, like a messenger particle in physics (Gluon etc) or even more fundamental?

Got excited when you mentioned compression remembering I had written something in my big file of ideas about it but when I went and checked it was sadly not very profound.

'Compression, when you make something take less space what does it lose?'

Don't even remember the context but there's another related thought later that probably isn't much help in actually answering your question but it tickled me at the time and is also tree related. How many trees can you take away before it stops being a forest?

Think you are right abut the poetry aspect I did another couple and they are not as satisfying because the words don't have any art to them. Pithy will definitely be one of my criteria for success going forward.

I see what you are saying about compression to a degree. A song could summarise a whole love affair or a poem, what it feels like to be outside on a sunny hilltop watching the clouds. But I think there is also an extent to which the compressed version or summary isn't just a dehydrated version you can plump back up with the application of some imagination but also a transformation into a different experience. Being in some cases a different medium or more generalised. When Seurat painted A Sunday on La Grande Jatte he was making a visual summary of what it looked like and being a pointalist, doing it in a very particular way. If a poet had been there and summarised the same scene do you think there would be any equivalence?

Apologies for thinking as I type. Less coherent but didn't want to let a fleeting thought slip away.

I read a good example of this compression a few years ago where the writer used the term closure, to describe the little pat on the back the brain gives itself when it recognises what a sketch is supposed to be. But I couldn't find the reference and Googling closure came up with all sorts of different stuff. But in that example a drawing of a persons face is obviously a dramatic reduction in the amount of information presented but if it's a half decent drawing the person will still be recognisable. So what I think I am trying to say is that the compressed version isn't equivalent to the thing but manages to be recognisable despite that.

That seems like a good thought I will have to let percolate!

In the meantime here's a nice picture of some French toffs out on a stroll.

> Is the idea that it's a bi-directional intermediary

I hadn't tried to approach it from that angle, interesting though; shall mull. To be honest, I am fascinated by field theory but don't feel comfortable within my grasp of it. Kinda though, I think my intuition is that there is something interesting in the way the two (let's say Logos & logos) are indirectly connected. I am not sure that I would go as far as to say that influence could be bi-directional (that idea could get spooky, real quick) but perhaps more that the pattern, whatever it is (if it is,) could inform in both directions: that the nature of the relation might shed some light on the related.


> Also out of practice. Not much of that sort of talk...

Don't get the idea that I am any fitter... I had some track advantage—not my first run of that course—and a -1.5% ABV advantage too! I am stumbling here already (but always up for a jaunt.)


> Added a little gravity simulator that will make decisions for you once I add some bubbles that say Leave, Stay and Drink Cool, I need all the help I can get with those decisions! I also like the idea of long term unemployed fellows getting chances at redemption but I assume that's just Lorem Ipsum? Was able to access your site for a while last week (before any bubbles) but have been getting connection time-outs since... not sure what's going on there, could well be my end.

[It was, tried later through a VPN and could reach no problem]  


> Apologies for thinking as I type. Less coherent but didn't want to let a fleeting thought slip away.

Not a problem, seemed coherent enough to me. Myself, I often break into rant and will be happy if I match your standard here (I have had a few coffees this morning.)


> not as satisfying because the words don't have any art to them

Now, understanding what that might might mean is kinda what I am trying to get to here. I feel I am stuck in the left hemisphere of my brain but, through meditation (and formerly psychedelics) have had a taste of the other side and want more... thinking of art as compression is a perhaps desperate (and maybe doomed) way to try to tunnel through.  I will get back to art and compression later [watch this space...]
Meantime:::
Imagine a gallery: the exhibition space is the outer surface of a giant sphere around which snakes a walkway; there are countless exhibits, each of them a different word. Each word is rendered uniquely: some in tiny type, others are massive murals; the face of some a solid colour, others a pattern, some an image. Occasionally, if a viewer is patient and relaxed, the word may open into a living window revealing with the light it admits some view of that which lies at the core, the meta-exhibit. Usually more than one word-window at a time will open and the light from the other associated windows reveals some further aspects of something ever-changing but momentarily frozen. When the window(s) close(s), the word of the exhibit is enlarged and rendered anew. Open or closed, no exhibit ever appears exactly the same to any two viewers.
::: I am a frequent visitor to the Logos exhibit which has opened for me many a time... Apologies for being the crazy guy at the gallery saying: "but don't you see... in the fine detail... the answer to LtU&E!"  

> Seems like there's a few interpretations depending on the perspective you are coming from.

Indeed, most of the other regulars at exhibit Logos are either Christians or Jungians and we see very different things... Perhaps I should try to unpack my interpretation of the Stoic perspective on an other occasion as it is not entirely orthogonal but till ifthen here is something from the source (or as close as I have come).
 "Though this Logos is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep." Heraclitus (fragment 1)
"For Wisdom, listen not me but to the Logos, and know that all is one." Heraclitus (fragment 50)
[I restored Logos in place of the translation 'Word']

Wowsers so much to unpack. Will check out the Sean Carrol stuff. Know his physics and soporific voice but nothing poetic.

The unemployed fellows were a placeholder copied over from another experimental site at fictive.work where you can read the full story.

Back on the vipassana trail after a lengthy layoff. Thanks for the nudge.

A pop song is to love as Robinson's diluting is to an orange.

I'm enjoying your take on the word/logos but deep down have a feeling language may be the problem. For all its utility it has shoehorned itself into our brains and neuroplasticity has done the rest.

Noone without words ever ruminated themselves to death.

In the old meadows bar, now a hip Scandinavian joint waiting for the lads to turn up. I assume they have forgotten we were supposed to be testing an eight o'clock start rather than the usual nine. Stevie turned fifty this week!

Stand by for a longer transmission. The long weekend beckons...

Ah,  Bayesian I've heard seany (who autocorrected to Swamy) talk about that before. Will read.

> If a poet had been there and summarised the same scene do you think there would be any equivalence? What a great question! Yes I do, but perhaps I am stretching 'equivalence' a bit as I doubt there would be enough equivalence such that both poem and painting would be recognizably of the same scene.

Both artists might well have been present at the same point in space and time (or close enough—the universe is pretty good at working out it's point to circle collisions!) but their experiences would not have been exactly equivalent to start with.


> But I think there is also an extent to which the compressed version or summary isn't just a dehydrated version you can plump back up with the application of some imagination but also a transformation into a different experience

Absolutely, a huge extent! In many ways, compression is a terrible metaphor for art. 
First up, there is the potential confusion as to what gets compressed—compressing a scene to a photo, or the photo to a jpeg file, does not art make. There, it is only the visual-likeness that gets preserved: in art I'd say it is more the feeling-likeness that gets preserved. I am suggesting art as compressed experience. The compression metaphor is also too suggestive of a digital algorithm and I am talking about a very analogue algorithm, something inherently noisy and lo-fi. We decoder/encoders are all at least subtly different, unique. Each decoding is a partially personal interpretation; each encoding is also a partially personal interpretation. We are all very similar in some ways: a common architecture (human) and similar software (culture). But reliably unique in others: exact OS version plus software ecosystem and of course data (personal experience). Last but not least, there is also no need for there to be one tangible experience that gets compressed, musicians for example, are neither compressing noises nor recreating any one experience, they are rather, pulling from a whole range of past experiences to create a new one.
So why am I bothering with it? Well, as a metaphor I think it still has some strengths: it captures the sense of 'dramatic reduction' (lovely turn of phrase btw) and also that a separate, abstract medium is passed through, a relatively opaque intermediary language is used—the language of the soul/mind/brain. It is this last bit that both fascinates and excites the hacker in me.
Let me unpack what I mean about word art and ask again if you see something similar about visual art. I'll start with a picture (a handy stock image)

![Relevant Image!](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=4b43976f5a&attid=0.1.1&permmsgid=msg-f:1631852021651494628&th=16a580c48c8a56e4&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ8jWLEzqVFA3zvF9clk2zdsAh03Pa3t_mUK5Sadvkz1yVIvJqMP1m3Qui71_GogGK9llBGC0A7rGKIYQ5KfufpdFk0PN9-kIs7dyGbqgv_1nDsR4t8AKkSk-Lo&disp=emb)


Now,
Imagine a tree... A tree that was a sapling one hundred thousand years ago, that grew from a seed planted maybe a million years before that—the tree of human language: each leaf a word in current usage, each branch a family.  Find the leaf 'wise' and rewind three/four thousand years or so to see a much younger, smaller tree; the branch that sprouted 'wise' has been sucked back into the trunk and is now just a leaf itself '*weid-' (Proto-Indo-European). It still meant wise, it also meant both see and know (with so few words around in ancient times, each word had more work to do). Now roll time forward and watch '*weid-' grow... it will sprout many leaves like 'veda' in Sanskrit and 'idea' in Greek and will branch off many times, both 'see' and 'know' going their own ways. Today there are still some pretty ancient, perennial leaves growing, like 'druid' ('*deru-'((Oak)tree)+'*weid-'(wise)), but '*weid' itself is now long part of the heartwood.
When a breeze rustles the 'wise' leaf, the tree understands with the whole branch, and feels with this heartwood. At least this is the story I like best, I don't think much of tales where words are like piano keys, one-to-one with some 'neural correlate'. Words, I fancy, are more like chords—playing patterns of neural activity rather than firing individual neurons. I further fancy that the still-sounding strings of the last chord affect the sound of the next, especially if some of the same strings are involved. 
The tree of words can only be visualized at a particular point in time, but it must reflect a structure in the brain where time is less granular, the boundaries of meaning more porous. 
Words shape brains, brains shape words....

![Relevant image!](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=4b43976f5a&attid=0.1.2&permmsgid=msg-f:1631852021651494628&th=16a580c48c8a56e4&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ-8gvr93loyxHXCLat7NTdTQtF5T6F8d_tzZIYVfeSpg7LOSCMPnnW5GGtC9bwWBLPBWI13JXguMsnIFTdrZ9u0Bfzmx7xiqjRUT-fbBOn1rXplEzfPt_6tOWs&disp=emb)


I think that the leaf 'wise' has a meaning that includes both the current definition (on the conscious, rational level) and also something etymological (from unconscious levels.) Etymology is not the only force at work down in the basement, there are lots of other ways that things quite distant from the definition of a word can influence it's interpretation: association, suggestion etc. This is the partially opaque intermediary layer I was positing. 
Metaphor can also be viewed as a great compression strategy as it leverages meaning from an assumed existing understanding and applies it in a different domain with very low overhead.
I guess what I am suggesting here boils down to: The artist, with their art, is playing the instrument that is the viewer/reader/listener's brain with a view to invoking some kind of experience; good art does this efficiently—less is more as far as the work of art is concerned. I'd add that on the other side (the unpacked, invoked experience) more is more in several dimensions: the number of viewers/readers/listeners that have a similar experience; how similar that experience is and how intense it is—good art expands our consciousness in that it causes us to experience more. Sound plausible?


> I read a good example of this compression a few years ago where the writer used the term closure Sounds like you were reading an application of Gestalt theory to visual art. I am not up on Gestalt, but am currently studying predictive processing which I believe tells a similar story in modern theory, proposing that the brain is working overtime in a top down way (imagining) to interpret bottom up information (perceptions). In PP our brains are actively trying to fit incoming sense data into re-cognizable patterns, whilst no fit can be made an error signal is produced which we experience as tension; when a good fit is made we feel a satisfying 'closure' (a state of dis-ease becomes one of ease). Current theory estimates that our experience is composed of only around 20-25% actual sense data and that the rest is predicted/imagined. 

PP is the main excitement in my mental life right now as it provides a playground with all my favourite toys: AI, cognitive science, philosophy and psychology. The theory even has profound implications for the practice of meditation! I think I could also even use it to reframe my question: Do you think that art is a skilful means to providing predictive processors the minimal stimuli to produce magnificent experiences?
'Closure', by-the-way, is one of Gestalt's 'Laws of Pragnanz'—It might tickle you to know that pragnanz is German for pithy! (not sure of the etymology but looks suggestively like pregnant...)

Cheers,

PS if you're new to PP and curious, Anil Seth gave a good TED talk that introduces the idea with some cool examples.

sorry another short one still trying to digest this feast!

This fellow tweaked me a couple of times mentioning the speaker being affected as well as the listener. But I guess not strictly stoic and crossing streams somewhat.

Logos shifts and slides across domains.

So inspired by planet logos I authored another art thing much more ambitious (at least in terms of size) but just as easy to Make!

Build a small moon.

Cover the moon with an endless path.

Walk along the path feeling the moon being pushed back by your feet.

Reading a basic stoicism for dummies book as I feel I have some suspect foundations but also have the meditations to dip into.

Is there any supernatural element to the way you are thinking about it? Or is it more a deep language developmental sense?

Practical wisdom FTW!

Watched mr Seth’s talk. V good and intriguing. Feel that yoga practice, which is often talked of as grounding, along with other similar physical activities that build propriception, jui jitsu and so on. Are actuall firming up the embodied part of the embodied consciousness that he talks about.

Seems to be working, probably just drawing more attention to ourselves
but laws here are pretty draconian and I hate training googles AI for free.

PS Wasn't trying to plug Swami's 'The Big Picture', just curious if that
was where you encountered him. Was listening to his latest podcast with
Antionio Damasio t'other day and felt a little sorry for Sean, not only
would I recommend Damasio's book 'The Strange Order of Things' over
Sean's, Damasio has a great voice!


> Is there any supernatural element to the way you are thinking about it? Or is it more a deep language developmental sense?

Neither really... I will try to get my logos-y thoughts together in some sort of send-able shape soon-ish.
Meantime, cheers for the links. Hadn't seen the Seth one which was good—interesting stuff for sure. I just finished The Science of Storytelling which was applying cognitive science (including PP) to fiction and was a very read-able story about stories.
Will check out the Heidegger later, I have never been able to make much sense of the man and his unrepentant Nazi-ism kinda put me off making an effort. He is however a key figure in European thought so I will give Greg a go and get back to you.
Till then, I will leave you with some Marion Milner on her discovery of how to appreciate paintings. Milner is big inspiration for me these days and should offer a yin counter to the yang cognitive science of art...

"I had always been vaguely interested in pictures, but worried because so often I could not say what I liked; I never seemed to know how to decide, except on a few occasions when a picture would seem to leap at me before I had begun to look at it, when I was still busy about something else. But one day I stopped in front of a Cézanne still-life – green apples, a white plate and a cloth. Being tired, restless, and distracted by the stream of bored Sunday afternoon sight-seers drifting through the galleries, I simply sat and looked, too inert to remember whether I ought to like it or not. Slowly then I became aware that something was pulling me out of my vacant stare and the colours were coming alive, gripping my gaze till I was soaking myself in their vitality. Gradually a great delight filled me, dispelling all boredom and doubts about what I ought to like…. Yet it had all happened by just sitting still and waiting. If I had merely given a cursory glance, said: ‘Isn't that a nice Cézanne?’ and drifted on with the crowd, always urged to the next thing, I would have missed it all. And also if I had not been too tired to think I would have said: ‘Here is a Cézanne, here is something one ought to like’, and I would have stood there trying to like it but becoming less and less sure what I felt about it."
[...]
"I remembered to try out my new-found gesture of deliberately holding my attention wide[*], and apply it to looking at a picture. Resisting the very strong impulse to pass on and see what the next picture was, I simply stood and waited. Staring at the whole canvas, I now did deliberately what I had once before done out of sheer weariness, when looking at a Cézanne painting. Gradually my mind settled down to complete absorption, oblivious to all but the harmonies of shape and colour which once again took on a life of their own and continued to grow out of the paint the longer I looked. Bearing this in mind, I now thought I understood a little the exasperation of those Philistines who think that ecstatic enjoyment of pictures is sheer affectation. For if I had never happened to discover how to make this act of wide focus so that I could see the whole all at the same time, it would certainly have been affectation to stand for ten minutes in front of one picture and pretend I was not bored."
* this 'gesture' of 'wide attention' that she stumbled upon is (I believe) akin to a flow-like meditative mindful awareness  
-from 'A Life of One's Own'

probably not Milner's Cézanne, but one of my favourites
Apple Painting - Green Apples by Paul Cezanne
Are you art mystic or philistine (like me) ?

It was one of those happy accidents where I was shooting the other direction and turned round at an opportune moment.

Woke up in the early hours with a blinding insight. One of those that collapses under the slightest scrutiny but an interesting thought that prevented much sleep for the remainder of the night.

Because consiousness has a special relationship with quantum states (some people say) the entire universe was in a superposition for all of time until the first consiousness arose and observed it. In order to become observable the superposition had to collapse backwards through time through all the various states it needed to have been in to arrive at the final state in which it was first observed.

Its looking like a pig of a Thursday at work. Hope you are having more fun!

That's even more disorienting!
Sometimes I force myself to listen to people I suspect are bonkers (in case they are not, and I am) and I was listening to Roger Penrose (who probably is...) He suggested that rather than think of consciousness as a requirement to resolve a superposition, think of it as the product of the resolution... (or at least I think that was what he was saying)
I have a history of the double split experiment audiobook lined up for my next fall-asleep-to listening, so perhaps I will also be waking up in the night with quantum insights soon. So far though my only thought on the matter of superposition is that if I were coding a reality simulation... I wouldn't resolve anything unnecessary till the very last minute either...

Well I've sadly never had an experience like the one Marion Milner describes so I'm going to have to default to Phillie. But I'm going to Glasgow on Saturday for some galleries so will experiement with not paying that much attention.


Alan
    a blinding insight. One of those that collapses under the slightest scrutiny

I think I know what you mean. Many of the creatures surfacing into my field of awareness go scuttling off at the mere approach of attention, particularly in the twilight hours. Often this is for the best as so many, even those that initially feel promising, turn out to be quite unfit for words. Some however, especially those bold enough to grab the spotlight, dissolve despite retaining their promise as though it was the words that were unfit for them. How exquisitely energizing this promise of meaning can be! How often I have found myself, after catching a whiff of it, like my old beagle, hours later, miles from home, tongue-out panting, happy yet rabbit-less.
I am trying to learn patience… to simply sit and wait, trusting that those ideas that are worthwhile will resurface in new words, words that can withstand a bit more scrutiny. For, then I can turn up the scrutiny still further until it all collapses again, and hopefully resurfaces anew. But I am about as patient as my beagle was. Too often I relax the scrutiny letting the wording remain fluent, so that the structure of thought lingers longer, feeding goodness knows what addiction. There is a fine line between supporting meaning and scaffolding nonsense… I am not speaking of your quantum insight here (I’ll get to that later) but about my logos musings; there is an art to this scrutiny business.
Standing back at my exhibit logos, which continues to open up for me, Milner-like, I am struggling to find the right words, words that can both withstand scrutiny and reveal what I see. But this, right here, presents an opportunity. I am jumping the gun a bit, blurting out of context, but this iterative process of scrutiny that can take a shy insight and process it into compressed and world-tested knowledge, this is an aspect of logos. From collapsing insight to articulated statement: this is logos at work. I will provide the context for that soon… Part of the problem I am having in finding words here is because the damned thing keeps collapsing on me. I think there are two reasons for this (besides the scrutiny), the second is that my viewpoint seems to be shifting to a more process (that object) oriented perspective and my poor brain keeps dropping everything when I try to make this turn.
The first reason I am struggling, is that it is a truly hard thing to pin down. Logos, despite being a concept that is foundational to almost all western thought—from the pre-Socratic to the Stoic, Christian through to the modern scientific world-views logos (or logic) is key—there is little ground to stand upon in terms of clear definition and consistent interpretation. I liked Heidegger’s take, some useful ideas there, and I hope to have something more substantial for your scrutiny soon.
I enjoyed your quantum insight in a Koan or Haiku like way, so thanks for sharing. Your words hit me right at the problem I have with the Copenhagen interpretation… There is an inherent dualism baked into this observation business that I just can’t get my head around:
How can we draw a line between observer and observed? And how come the observed is ‘quantum’ but the observer is ‘classical’?
The very notion of an independent observer comes with a bit too much baggage for me and a circularity that your words artfully show.
PS Happy Buddha's Birthday! — its a holiday here.


> What's your understanding of Telos?

I haven't really explored telos in Greek usage, but have some views on the derived Teleology which I have encountered a fair bit in English. I have thought about teleology so much that it makes it hard for me to look at the root in a way that is not deeply coloured by my ideas about teleology—the idea that there is a 'purpose' behind the Cosmos.
As an undergrad biology student, I read Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker and it sort of immunised me from all notions of Teleology for quite some time... Later, much later, I started to come across the ideas of Teilhard de Chardin quite regularly, and in places that inclined me to take the idea more seriously (he was popular amongst a number of meditation, yoga and other 'spiritual' teachers I have found valuable, as well with several authors that I respect.) Despite having found the idea quite intuitively seductive on occasion, I can't get past the 'razor'— never attribute to purpose anything that can be adequately explained by a dumb algorithm working on random variation in an non-random way. But this 'non-random way' still seems problematic to me—on both sides. On the pro teleology side, whilst I am down with evolution, working on chance variation, being capable of generating all the complexity we see, I am uncomfortable concluding from this that everything is random, it's all relative and there is no meaning! On the other side, whilst I reject the previous conclusion, I think concluding 'purpose' is a stretch too far (however loud the denials of god-smuggling are.) For me, the truth has to lie somewhere in between, in a place that has no adequate labels in English (or perhaps Human!) 
This 'theory of mind' business has a lot to answer for, I think it has us projecting agency onto things far too liberally (a bit like that dog video algorithm in the PP video I sent you). Even Dawkins—an explainer of science par excellence—failed to get across the notion of gene-level selection without using the metaphor of agency and that was not without unfortunate consequence. I don't doubt the notion of agency can be extremely useful in an explanatory way, but I am not at all sure that it is much of a real thing...
Instead of 'purpose' I like 'function' as in teleometry—it has less agent-bias, I am okay with things having functions and I think that the questions that arise from this are slightly less unwieldy.
On the Stoic front—there is no denying it, Stoicism was teleological—I see the concept more like a crane (vs a skyhook). Kinda like the idea of a higher power: this idea is invaluable not because there is a higher power per se, but because the belief functions as a device that can lift us out of egotism—it doesn't matter if there is not a 'God' out there helping 'you', there is help out there if you can get over yourself as being the centre of the universe... So, in the same way, I don't think it matters whether there is a 'divine purpose' to get in tune with because 'God', what matters is that there is a better way than your way: 'thy will be done' is better that 'my will be done' if 'my will' is my ego on autopilot, and 'thy will' helps me transcend said ego on autopilot in a bigger picture kinda way. Personally, I don't think God and purpose are required, but something is (like perhaps the view from nowhere, or the Cosmic perspective), and until we get something better in place, I worry about throwing the baby out with the bath water... In telos, Stoicism retains baby and bathwater, for Marcus, I think that the Cosmos was a watch, but no watchmaker was necessarily required. But this is only how I read Marcus, whether that is all in my interpretation, that of the translators I prefer, or was actually 'in' The Meditations; well, that might depend on how one understands telos...

I have returned to ideas of mind-mapping of late and am playing with freemind, it seems flexible and well put together (at least on Linux, but I think it's Java, so should be consistent across platforms) but I am hardly a power user. I used it to plan my logos thoughts though, the first instalment of which I attach in good faith (hope .odt works for you—let me know if not)

Black chicks in the basement eh... (that might be worth encrypting btw) and you've got a Janelle Monae down there... lucky B.
When I was on the cusp of my teens I crushed out on Pauline Black the first time I saw her on top of the pops (Three Minute Hero I think.) I thought she was super neat and I think I must have imprinted on her as a goddess of groove. Almost 30 years later I discovered Janelle and it was like she was channelling the young Pauline's groove. When I found out her album was a concept album, and no less a concept that an exploration of race and gender in a retelling of Fritz Lang's Metropolis... man! (Tightrope is still my favourite dance video of all time) Anyway yeah, I watched hidden figures. You were probably more thinking of the other characters though.
I finished Through Two Doors at Once without waking up with any quantum insights, alas. Good book though, found out about the following experiment in it, it's got a cool name in 'the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment'. Freaky shit. Simply put, they went to the Canaries on a starless and bible black night with a source that emits pairs of entangled photons. They measured the spin of one photon locally on a mountain top on La Palma and fired its partner off towards a waiting telescope at the Tenerife observatory. This was to introduce a half millisecond delay, during which they either kept or scrambled the information about the local photon (using some kind of quantum random number generator.) If the local measurement was scrambled (erased) then the other photon arrived as a wave in an interference pattern, if not it arrived as a particle... The erasing of the measurement data happened 150 miles away, half a millisecond beforehand—spooky action at a distance apparently!
Great point about the timeline mapping. It amazes me sometimes, how impoverished the thought of non-programmers can be! It freaks physicists out a bit, but there would be no need to simulate an actual universe in any kind of 1-to-1 way with respect to time or space, only our experience of it (a much simpler task), and anything more that JIT resolution of details would just be mindbogglingly inefficient. 
Good job with the rowing form spot. When I used to run more seriously, I found it almost impossible to be aware of my form, the closer I got to the zone, the more my proprioceptive awareness shrank away and was replaced by a sort of exterioceptive(?) awareness of the terrain. I think I ran for months with a collapsing ankle and needed someone else to point it out to me! Incidentally, when I used to run trails and the going got tough and I had to reach deep etc. I hummed the rhythm of the Bodysnatchers' "Do rocksteady.., do rocksteady.., uhuh!" to get me into the rhythm of flow. The Bodysnatchers were a bunch of housewives compared to Pauline or Janelle, but I have their rhythms embedded deep!
