# Fear Of Finishing

I used to write a lot. Meaning I would pore over the same 400 words for days. Polishing the story until there was nothing left but the dust of ideas.

These bouts of authorship would lure me away from real work. Their siren song hobbling my productivity, such as it was. This most insidious form of procrastination still feels like you are being useful. But the utility in a short story is questionable at best and poverty is a great motivator. So I kicked writing to the curb. Unable to find a balance between the joy of words and the necessity of income.

When I clamber back on the keyboard now I am much more disciplined. Bashing out more or less what I want in a couple of feverish revisions. Some of the enjoyment is gone but no one will be grading these at the end of the day. So I concentrate on communicating the idea and leave the flowery satisfactions unsaid.

But the old ghosts still haunt me. Despite the initial few stories being already written. The rest of the site has taken weeks of development and gone through 4 different platforms. Some of that time was a desire to question well understood fundamentals. After all the beginners mind is a desirable place to visit. But don't take up residence. The rest was an endless fiddling. All too familiar from days long gone.

How much more productive could I be if I imposed similar time restrictions to those I have at at work. But is that even what I want? Isn't part of the enjoyment of a hobby the practice itself. Pottering around in the garden of this website may be its own reward.

Or is it the [fear of finishing](https://www.fastcompany.com/3025757/why-you-can-never-finish-anything-and-how-to-finally-change-it) that throttles so many ideas in their cribs.

At least the site exists now and you can judge for yourself whether it was a worthwhile endeavour.

For my developer friends with an interest I used Hugo in the end. Finishing 2 weeks before they released a new version with so many improvements that it renders this site a mockery!
