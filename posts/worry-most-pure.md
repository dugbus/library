# Worry Most Pure

The thing I worry about most, lying in a filthy sweat, in the wee, small hours of the morning is not nuclear annihilation or even global warming, which considering the recent unrelenting heat would be top of most people’s lists but instead, it is that I may be an idiot.

I remember hearing my mother refer to me on several occasions over the years as special, including when she was gravely ill in the hospital. So I assume it was somewhat important to her. But now I fear that rather than complimenting her offspring she may have been inferring special needs. (Not sure if that phrase now falls in the problematic basket but I’m self identifying so you can fuck off if its a problem for you).
