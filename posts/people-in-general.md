# People In General

I don’t know. I’ve heard folk say that writing is therapy so I am going to try to use it to excise some memories that just keep popping up and lowering my quality of life. Maybe I have recalled them so often over the years that the neural pathways have been reinforced to the point that they are now more or less hardwired, but I’ll give it a shot.

Anyway, the first one is a prime nobber who I can still see very clearly whenever he bubbles up. Probably not well enough to recognise him in the street, which is fortunate because I wouldn’t want to throat punch some random just because of a strong resemblance. But many years ago I was walking down the lane behind the Conan Doyle that led from The St James Centre to the traffic lights at the top of Broughton Street.

It is quite narrow and cobbled with a strictly one person at a time pavement running down the opposite side to the Conan Doyle. There’s an older lady in front of me who is moving a good deal slower than I am so I step out onto the cobbles to pass her. Just as the aforementioned nobber turns his car into the bottom of the lane. I see him coming but I’m far enough on my way passed the lady that continuing forward will be the quickest way to get back to the pavement.

I look towards the car as I hustle downhill and see the driver make a gesture that even mimicking now in order to describe it for this story makes the blood sing in my ears. He points towards the pavement needlessly indicating I should get out of his way. His hand is above the steering wheel and clenched in a fist. The index finger extended to his left. All of the movement comes from his wrist and he pumps it twice for emphasis. And that’s it. I hop back on the pavement barely in front of the lady as he powers passed staring straight ahead.

Why does he haunt me so? I’ve forgotten my own birthday twice and where I lived that one time I was being interviewed by the police. But this dick stinks up my psyche so badly that I’ve sent him enough bad vibes over the years that if that sort of thing worked he’d be a homeless leper at best. And there doesn’t seem to be any sort of trigger. He activates seemingly at random. I wonder if I even crossed his mind later that day, never mind a quarter of a century later.

Well let’s give it a few days and see if writing this helps.

The next one is a huge step down in anger levels but more than holds her own in irritation. I think at least partly because she wasn’t someone I could even shout at without everyone being on her side.

After yoga at Union (RIP) on a Saturday morning if no-one else fancied a coffee I would often head down to Urban Angel for a tuna toastie and peppermint tea. The untoasted toasties are on some shelves to the right of the door as you come in, next to a couple of stools facing out into the street. I was searching the shelves for tuna or possibly a veggie haggis, which would have been a rare and exciting treat.

I’m on my tippie toes to see the sandwich labels without having to go along lifting them all up and I hear the bell ding indicating the door has opened behind me. A few moments later I descend from my tiptoes having located a suitable toastie and turn towards the counter, smacking my mat bag, which is quite heavy into the pram that has mysteriously appeared two inches behind me. I stumble a bit a look up towards the pram driver who has been trying to manoeuvre it between the stools so she can sit at the window. She stares quite blankly at me for several long seconds then says ‘Ouch’ loudly enough that people at the tables in the next room turn to see what’s going on. I mean, what a psycho.

I untangle myself from the pram and head to the counter but I can feel her soulless eyes burning into the back of my head and my meal has been completely ruined before it even began. Those vacant eyes swallowed all of my attention so I have no idea what she looked like except for a vague glimmer of a roll neck sweater, possibly Aran. Why won’t this woman leave me alone?

The last bad one was a genuine prick who called me to arrange a Mercedes test drive. Now I have had about two driving lessons in my entire life and spent many years resolutely over the limit so have had little to no interest in driving anything let alone a car for bawbags (only kidding Adam). in fact I have been patiently waiting for self driving cars to turn up since Tomorrow’s World predicted they were right around the corner in the 70’s. No idea how a none driver like myself would end up being called to arrange a Mercedes test drive, apart from a very faint recollection of entering a competition to win one.

So the chap phones me and I listen to his spiel for a while until he pauses for breath at which point I explain that I don’t drive and don’t have enough money to afford a chauffeur, which I thought was kind of funny and might be a good way to let him down gently. Unfortunately he was not amused and somehow it became my fault for not being able to drive that he had wasted his time. I wish I could remember his exact wording but it amounted to something like, “Right then so we agree that you are a terrible person for being on a marketing list for test drives when you can’t actually drive.”

It had been quite a while since this guy popped into my consciousness. Probably since I got rid of my landline but going over the other two to write them up must have woken him and now I keep feeling his tone of disapproval and a stab of unearned guilt. Maybe this exercise wasn’t such a good idea after all.

I’m going to finish on a positive entry to try and salvage something from this debacle.

This one is actually quite a nice memory but I’ve spent so long over the years languishing in the embrace of its recollection I could have written a book with the time and retired from the hectic world of web development.

This may also have been a post yoga event as the timing is right and I can feel my mat bag when I try to remember what happened. Also, unlike the others, it’s a known year as will become evident below.

I had reached the top of Broughton Street and was deciding whether to cross the road to go to the Omni Centre cinema to see the second Pirates of the Caribbean film (2006) or turn onto Picardy Place to head home for something to eat. The reported length of the film put me off though as I was quite hungry, so I began to make my way towards Leith Walk. Just as I passed behind the statue of Sherlock Holmes a gaggle of youngish woman burst out of the Holiday Inn ahead. Clearly a Hen Do, I think there may have been a champagne breakfast involved.

One of the girls beckoned me to stop and asked if I could help with one of the Hen’s challenges. I was a bit confused but agreed that I would help if I could. The Hen then stepped forward and was wearing a t-shirt with a list of things to do. She said, “We need to kiss now” and we did. It was quite an awkward moment surrounded by a huge cloud of oestrogen but I held her and we kissed. Longer than a peck but not quite a smooch. I definitely felt something more than the usual stirrings and judging by her expression she did too. Or maybe it was just the champers. We stood, still connected for a few seconds until the person who had first spoken to me shouted ‘Thanks!’ and started drawing a tick in the checkbox next to ‘Kiss a Baldy Man’ on the Hen’s t-shirt.

And then they were gone. I did contemplate heading up town later that day on the off chance I would bump into them again. But it had just been a moment and the moment was gone.

Why do we remember some things and not others. These don’t seem any more important than the tens of thousands of interactions that have vanished into the quantum fizz that constitutes my consciousness. Why can I remember the girl at the party telling me that elephants are matriarchal and then starting to explain what matriarchal means before apologising for womansplaining and laughing the sweetest laugh. Or realising there was only one other person in the room and that we were both technically dancing with Gordon, who amongst many other attributes is gay and has achondroplasia. Although, actually I can understand remembering that last one.

If only I could remember some of the things I’ve forgotten, then I could compare them with the things I’ve actually remembered and see if there is some reason behind it. Or is it all just random.
